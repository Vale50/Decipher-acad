    Dear David,
    How are you doing? I hope you are doing great and well? I know with full heart,everything is going well. Am writing this letter to you in telling you about my future career and how it will benefit our country Nigeria.
    Firstly, I have been having so much thought on how I will add to the promotion of this country,i have made some thought an I got some inspirations which I know it will be very helpful in this country especially at this time, and I had come to a conclusion on letting it out but I had only told these plans to my parent and you. I hope you will check it out I know what you think about it.
    Furthermore, one of the plan I have in mind is building an hospital in this our town, because am finding out that a lot of people in our village has been dying due to no developed and skilled hospital in our town and this has hurt me so bad that people die some get ills and no one can do anything concerning it that’s why am deciding of becoming a medical student so that I could find a way to help my people from this medical lack which has brought a lot of harm to us. Even the herbalist that they are relying on is not even help the matter so well.
    Moreover, when I become medical doctor, I could be able to save lives and have enough mother to help purify our town bole hole water because I noticed that there are some particles penetrating inside the water when been fetched and this could be very harmful to the people, even I guess this is mostly one of the cause of peoples illness in our town but I will try as much as possible to find out a cure that could saturate the water and make it clean and also cure those that has already been infected by it.
    More so, by me becoming a medical doctor probably the first medical doctor, I can open a teaching hospital for the youth who would want to become a nurse and they will be trained and this could even lead to employment in our society and reduce the rate of youth parading around our town with no aim.
    In summary,this doctor I want to become is just like the perfect idea for me and the society because this could help everyone and keep everyone healthy and bring about development to our society even employment to our youth.
    In conclusion, I am only telling you this David because you are my very good friend and I would want your prayer as well so that I could help keeping our people from sickness, from illness and also bring about employment. THANK YOU.
    Yours Sincerely,
    kelvin.

  <p>5.Write a story which illustrates the saying: Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.

            <button>Explanation</button>
            <div class="answer hidden"> Uneasy Lies the Head that Wears the Crown
                This saying explains the fact that it is difficult to be a leader and even more difficult to be at th helm of affairs. When one sees himself in a position of authority, a lot is expected from that person. The individual faces a lot of ups and downs. If he is a good leader, many will admire him and many will also hate him. No matter the level of your good governance you must have oppositions and criticism even from your own people.
                A true story of this adage can be seen from the life of Moses whom God appointed to lead the people of Israel when they were suffering in the land of Egypt. After they might have cried for many years, he decided to deliver them from the hands of the Egyptians, to send them to the promised land. (the land flowing with milk and honey). To accomplish this. God called Moses and gave him the crown of leadership to lead the people of Israel out of the land of affliction.
                When he started his leadership career. he was finding things very difficult, as he had several encounters, problems and challenges with God, with Pharoah, the Egyptian, the Isrealites and even with his household. As the mantle of leadership rested on Moses, he started acting according to God’s instruction. In the process he discovered that to be a leader entails a lot of responsibilities. In the first instance, the people refused to believe and hearken to him. He was accused of usurping powers, hence the question "who made you a king and a ruler over us?" From that moment he realized the fact that uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.
                Although Moses was made a god over Pharaoh his leadership tenure wasn’t a bed of roses. When they were finally allowed to leave Egypt, they made their journey in the wilderness and they encountered a lot of problems. They were worried and resorted to blaming and insulting Moses. Their disgusting murmuring increased day-in-day-out against Moses and his God, despite the glory of the Lord that accompanied them. Notwithstanding, they hearkened not unto Moses. They complained when they were hungry. They murmured against Moses and he cried to God and they were given manna. When they were thirsty they complained bitterly against Moses. Again Moses cried to God they were given water.
                Many a time the people murmured against Moses saying, "take us back to Egypt. You have brought us out of Egypt to kill us and our children". As they were about to stone him, he cried unto the Lord. Moses as a leader was bearing the burden of leadership alone and it was not easy on him at all.
                The behaviour of the Isrealites in the wilderness aggrieved Moses especially when they started worshiping false gods. Out of annoyance, he broke the table containing the commandments of God. As a result of that, the wrath of God came upon him. This particular offence/encounter denied Moses the opportunity of entering the promised land. He later paid with his dear life.
                From this story, one can see actually that it is not easy to be a leader, hence the popular saying "Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown".

<p>6. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it.

    Armed robbery is one of the most condemnable crimes in contemporary society. People have been maimed or killed for their money or belongings in the past, but never has robbery with violence been experienced on such a large scale as observed recently. Armed robbery is typically motivated by the desire to obtain money and valuables. However, some armed robbers engage in the crime with the intention of boosting their status. Whatever the motivation, the act is inhumane and can result in injury and sometimes the death of the victims.
    
    It is rather unfortunate that in almost all modem societies there are always groups of unemployed young people. Some are unemployable because they have little or no education and lack skills.
    
    What is even worse, these young people are often unprepared for and unwilling to do any manual work to earn an honest living. They tend to blame society for their plight and retaliate by indulging in acts of crime and lawlessness. They grab money and valuable properties of their victims to enable them to survive in a society which seems to ignore them. To reduce the instances of armed robbers, parents should do their best to nurture their children in the right way because charity begins at home. They should instill good values in them and should not hesitate to correct them early in life when they bring home something that does not belong In them.
    
    The rich, on the other hand, who are mostly the target or armed robbers provide another cause. Some show of their wealth ostentatiously, live flamboyantly, go about in flashy and sophisticated cars, hop from one exotic island to another on holidays, and brag about all their escapades on social media much to the annoyance and envy of the unemployed youth. To bridge the gap between the haves and the have-nots, the government should provide the basic necessities for its citizens. Social services should be made available to those without jobs. The provision of such amenities to eater for the entire populace would help to improve the living conditions of the unemployed and underemployed. The adequate provision of infrastructure would ensure that every individual has access to the basic comforts of life.
    
    The breakdown of traditional systems, resulting in the loss of moral and spiritual values, has made wealth the only thing of value in the eyes of the youth. The ostentatious display of ill-gotten wealth is applauded and the society hardly questions its source. Many young people therefore engage in all manner of nefarious activities including armed robbery to make money in order to enjoy the delights and comforts of modern life and above all, be celebrated by their society. Law enforcement authorities can further reduce the spate of armed robberies by monitoring places known for high incidence of the crime. Constant and intrusive patrols of crime-prone areas can deter potential offenders.
    
    (a)	In three sentences, one for each, summarize the factors that make some youths go into armed robbery.
    
    (b)	In three sentences, one for each, summarize how armed robbery' can be reduced.
