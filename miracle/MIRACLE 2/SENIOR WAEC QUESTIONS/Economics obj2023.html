        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> The correct answer is B. make choice when resources are inadequate.

            Explanation:
            Economics is fundamentally the study of how individuals, businesses, and societies make choices in the face of scarcity. Scarcity refers to the basic economic problem that resources (such as time, money, raw materials, etc.) are limited, while human wants and needs are virtually unlimited. Because of this, economics focuses on how to allocate these limited resources to meet the most pressing needs and desires.</div></br>
        On the other hand,
        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
A. rank individuals’ wants given the abundant resources: This option is incorrect because it assumes that resources are abundant, which contradicts the central concept of scarcity in economics. If resources were abundant, there would be no need to rank wants or make difficult choices.
</br>


        </div></br>
        Also,
        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
C. satisfy every member of all societies: This option is incorrect because it is impossible to satisfy every member of society given the limited resources available. Economics instead studies how to make the best possible choices to maximize welfare given these constraints.
</div>
        </br>
        And lastly,
        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
D. produce all the goods needed by everyone: This option is incorrect because it assumes that it's possible to produce everything needed by everyone, which ignores the reality of limited resources. Economics involves making decisions about what goods and services to produce, how to produce them, and for whom they should be produced. </div>

C. Secondary Production: This sector involves manufacturing and processing, where raw materials from the primary sector are converted into finished goods. Warehousing is not part of the production process itself but is a service that aids in the distribution of goods after they have been produced.

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> An economic system primarily deals with how to allocate limited or scarce resources to meet the needs and wants of a society.

A. Handling situations of abundant resources: This is incorrect because economics primarily concerns itself with the scarcity of resources. If resources were abundant, there would be no need for an economic system to allocate them.

" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
B. Studying the relationship between ends and means: While economics does involve analyzing the relationship between goals (ends) and the resources (means) available to achieve them, this is more of a general description of what economics as a field of study entails, rather than the primary concern of an economic system.

C. The establishment of economic laws: This is also incorrect. While economic laws (like supply and demand) are important, the main function of an economic system is the practical application of these laws to allocate scarce resources, not just the establishment of the laws themselves. </div>

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> Correct Answer: D. Perfectly price inelastic
            When the demand for a commodity remains constant despite changes in price, the commodity is said to be perfectly price inelastic. This means that the quantity demanded does not change at all, no matter how much the price increases or decreases. In economic terms, the price elasticity of demand (PED) is zero.</div></br>

A. Price elastic:

If a commodity is price elastic, it means that the quantity demanded changes significantly in response to price changes. If the price goes up, demand typically decreases, and if the price goes down, demand increases. This option is incorrect because price elasticity involves a change in demand, not a constant demand.
</br>

        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
B. Unit price elastic:

Unit price elasticity means that the percentage change in quantity demanded is exactly equal to the percentage change in price. For example, if the price increases by 10%, the demand decreases by 10%. This option is incorrect because, under unit price elasticity, demand would change in response to price changes.

            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
C. Price inelastic:

While "price inelastic" implies that demand does not change much with price changes, it does not imply that demand remains completely constant. In price inelastic demand, there is still some change, albeit small, in the quantity demanded when the price changes. This option is incorrect because it does not describe a situation where demand remains perfectly constant.</div>

        </br>
        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> Fairly Inelastic Demand (Correct Answer): When the demand for a product is fairly inelastic, consumers are less sensitive to price changes. This means that even if the price of the product increases (due to a tax, for example), the quantity demanded doesn't decrease significantly. As a result, buyers end up bearing more of the tax burden because they continue to purchase the product despite the higher price.

            <img src="/

A. Elastic Demand: If a product has elastic demand, consumers are very sensitive to price changes. If the price increases (due to a tax), the quantity demanded would decrease significantly, leading to a larger portion of the tax burden being borne by the seller. This is the opposite of what happens when the buyer bears more of the tax burden.

            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
C. Perfectly Elastic Demand: In a perfectly elastic demand situation, even a tiny increase in price would cause the quantity demanded to drop to zero. Here, the seller would bear the entire tax burden because the buyer would stop purchasing the product entirely if the price increases.

D. Perfectly Inelastic Demand: With perfectly inelastic demand, the quantity demanded remains constant regardless of price changes. Theoretically, the buyer would bear all of the tax burden because their demand doesn’t change at all with price changes. However, the term "fairly inelastic demand" in the context of the question suggests a situation where the demand is somewhat inelastic but not perfectly so, making option B more appropriate for the scenario described.</div>

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> Explanation:
            Elastic demand means that the quantity demanded of a commodity is very sensitive to changes in its price. Specifically, when the demand is elastic, a small decrease in price leads to a relatively larger increase in the quantity demanded.
            
            Revenue is calculated as the price of the commodity multiplied by the quantity sold (Revenue = Price × Quantity).
            
            Why D. a decrease in revenue is correct:
            When the price of a normal commodity with elastic demand falls, the quantity demanded increases significantly. However, because the price has decreased and the demand is elastic, the percentage decrease in price outweighs the percentage increase in quantity demanded. This results in a lower total revenue.</div></br>

            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
B. an increase in revenue: This is incorrect because, in the case of elastic demand, a price decrease leads to a decrease in revenue, not an increase. The increase in quantity demanded does not compensate enough for the lower price.

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> C. shift to the left: This is the correct answer because if the government stops providing subsidies for cocoa production, the cost of production will increase for producers. As a result, some producers may reduce their production or exit the market altogether. This reduction in production leads to a decrease in the overall supply of cocoa, causing the supply curve to shift to the left.</div></br>

A. shift to the right: This option is incorrect because a shift to the right would indicate an increase in supply, which would occur if production costs decreased or if there were technological improvements, not if subsidies were removed.

            This is the correct answer. When the marginal utility of a commodity (MUX) is greater than its price (PX), it means that the consumer derives more satisfaction or utility from consuming an additional unit of the commodity than what they have to pay for it. A rational consumer will continue to consume more of commodity X until the marginal utility equals the price (MUX = PX). At this point, the consumer maximizes their total utility, and the consumption becomes optimal.</div></br>

Option B: Reduce consumption of commodity X.
This option is incorrect because if MUX > PX, reducing consumption would decrease the total utility. The consumer is getting more utility than the cost, so reducing consumption would not be rational.

This option is incorrect because if MUX > PX, maintaining the current level of consumption means the consumer is not maximizing their utility. The consumer should consume more until MUX = PX.

Option D: Strive to remain in disequilibrium.

Fixed costs are those that do not change with the level of output, such as salaries of permanent employees. When workers are retrenched, these fixed costs generally go down.

B. Marginal cost may increase: This option is incorrect because retrenching workers typically reduces production capacity, which may reduce output. Marginal cost is the cost of producing one additional unit of output. If production is reduced, the marginal cost of producing additional units would not be directly impacted by retrenching workers. Instead, it might become relevant if the firm needs to hire additional workers or invest in capital to increase production later.

D. Variable cost will decline: This option is incorrect because variable costs change with the level of production. If the firm retrenches workers, it might reduce production, which could lead to a decrease in variable costs. However, the primary effect of retrenching workers is on fixed costs, not directly on variable costs. </div>

        </br>
        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> Price exceeds average total cost:

            For a monopolist to enjoy abnormal (or economic) profit, the price charged for the good or service must be greater than the average total cost (ATC) of producing it. This means that the revenue per unit (price) is higher than the cost per unit (ATC), leading to positive economic profit.</div></br>

            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
Marginal cost exceeds marginal revenue:

If marginal cost (MC) exceeds marginal revenue (MR), the firm is not in a profit-maximizing position. In this case, the monopolist would be producing too much and would actually be reducing profits or increasing losses. Profit maximization occurs where MC equals MR.
</br>

            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
Demand curve is perfectly elastic:

A perfectly elastic demand curve (horizontal line) implies that the price remains constant regardless of the quantity sold. In such a situation, the firm is a price taker (like in perfect competition) rather than a monopolist. Monopolists typically face a downward-sloping demand curve.
</div>

            <img src="/

Expenditure on advertisement increases:

Increasing expenditure on advertising does not guarantee abnormal profit. While advertising can affect demand, the key determinant of abnormal profit is whether the price exceeds average total cost. Advertising affects demand and can influence sales, but it does not directly affect the cost structure or the relationship between price and ATC. </div>

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> Why Option A is Correct:
            Supply Curve Relationship: In a perfectly competitive market, the firm's supply curve is derived from its marginal cost (MC) curve above the average variable cost (AVC). The AR curve (which equals the price) is constant, and firms decide their output based on where the price equals their MC. Therefore, the supply curve of the firm in a perfectly competitive market coincides with the AR curve above the AVC.</div></br>

            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
B. Demand Curve of the Firm: In a perfectly competitive market, the demand curve faced by an individual firm is perfectly elastic (horizontal) at the market price, which is the same as the AR curve. However, the term "demand curve" generally refers to the market demand curve, not the firm's individual demand curve.

            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
C. Total Revenue Curve of the Firm: The total revenue (TR) curve represents the total revenue generated from selling different quantities of output. In a perfect market, the TR curve is a straight line starting from the origin and increasing at a constant rate (since TR = Price × Quantity). While the average revenue is the total revenue divided by quantity, it does not directly represent the TR curve.

D. Average Cost Curve of the Firm: The average cost (AC) curve represents the per-unit cost of production, which is unrelated to the revenue curves. The AC curve indicates how costs change with output, while the AR curve relates to revenue.

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> Malthusian Theory of Population:
            The Malthusian theory, proposed by Thomas Malthus, suggests that populations tend to grow exponentially (i.e., at a faster rate) while food supply grows at an arithmetic rate (i.e., at a slower, linear rate). This imbalance leads to overpopulation, which Malthus believed would result in famine, disease, and other forms of population control to restore balance.
            
            Why Option B is Correct:
            B. population increases much faster than food supply: This option accurately represents the Malthusian theory, which posits that population growth outpaces the growth of food supply, leading to a potential crisis where resources become insufficient to support the population.</div></br>

A. both population and food supply increase at the same rate: This option contradicts the Malthusian theory. If population and food supply increase at the same rate, there would be no imbalance, and the theory's prediction of crisis would not occur.

Double counting occurs when the value of intermediate goods (those used to produce final goods) is included in the GDP calculation, leading to an inflated measure.

            Why option B is correct:
            
            To avoid double counting, only the expenditure on final goods and services is included in the GDP calculation. Final goods are those that are purchased by the end user and are not used in the production of other goods.</div></br>

            In this case:
            
            NNP = $50 million
            Depreciation Allowance = $10 million

            GNP=$50million+$10million=$60million

A. $30 million: This option is incorrect because it is less than the NNP. Since GNP includes the depreciation allowance, it should be greater than NNP, not less.

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> Specialization of labour means that individuals or groups focus on producing specific goods or services. This specialization increases the efficiency and productivity of production. When people specialize in what they do best, they need a mechanism to exchange their specialized products for other goods and services they need. Money functions effectively as a medium of exchange in such scenarios because it provides a common measure of value and facilitates transactions between specialized producers.</div></br>

A. more people engage in subsistence production: Subsistence production means producing just enough to meet one's own needs without engaging in trade. In this case, money is less needed as there is minimal exchange or trade involved.

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> C. the same amount of money buys a lower quantity of goods
            This is the correct answer because inflation is characterized by a decrease in the purchasing power of money. When inflation occurs, the general price level of goods and services rises, meaning that each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services than it did before.</div></br>

            <img src="/

A. there is a decrease in the demand for goods and services
This option is incorrect because inflation is typically associated with an increase in demand for goods and services relative to their supply, which drives prices up. A decrease in demand is more indicative of deflation or an economic downturn.

B. there are too many goods in circulation
This option is incorrect because having too many goods in circulation usually leads to lower prices, not inflation. Inflation generally occurs when there is more money chasing a relatively stable amount of goods, not an excess of goods.
</div>

D. people prefer to lend than to borrow
This option is incorrect because inflation typically makes borrowing more attractive and lending less attractive. With inflation, the real value of money decreases, so borrowers benefit by repaying loans with money that is worth less. Lenders, on the other hand, face losses because the money they are repaid is worth less than when it was lent out. </div>

            Trade protection measures, such as tariffs and import quotas, can help protect new and emerging industries from foreign competition. By shielding these firms from international competition, they have a better chance to develop, grow, and become competitive. This can lead to economic growth as these firms mature and contribute to the economy.</div></br>

A. Eliminate importation of all commodities:
Eliminating all imports is impractical and detrimental. Imports are essential for providing goods and resources that may not be available domestically. Completely cutting off imports could lead to shortages, higher prices, and reduced consumer choice, negatively affecting economic growth.

B. Generate enough revenue through export duties:
While export duties might generate revenue, they do not directly support the growth of developing countries. High export duties can discourage exports and hurt the global competitiveness of domestic products. The focus should be on protecting and nurturing domestic industries rather than imposing export restrictions.

D. Allow the importation of cheaper goods people want:
Allowing the importation of cheaper goods might be beneficial for consumers due to lower prices but can harm local industries by exposing them to unfair competition. It doesn't support the protection or growth of newly established firms, which need time and support to become competitive. </div>

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> Developing tourism and other services (Option C) can cause a favorable change in the invisible trade account because the invisible trade account typically includes transactions related to services such as tourism, banking, insurance, and other intangible assets. By developing tourism, a country can attract foreign visitors who spend money on services, which improves the balance of payments in the invisible trade account.</div></br>

            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
Increasing the export of her primary products (Option A) affects the visible trade account, not the invisible trade account. The visible trade account deals with goods (tangible products) rather than services. So, while increasing exports of primary products can improve the visible trade balance, it does not directly impact the invisible trade account.

Imposing high tariffs on exports (Option B) is a measure that affects the visible trade account and can reduce the volume of exports. High tariffs are more likely to discourage exports, which could worsen the trade balance, rather than positively impacting the invisible trade account.
