            Step 1 Prepare a solution of calcium chloride: 
            Dissolve calcium chloride (CaCl2) in water to 
            create a calcium chloride solution. This step 
            involves measuring the appropriate amount of 
            calcium chloride and adding it to a container of 
            distilled water while stirring until the compound is 
            completely dissolved.
            Step 2 Add a source of carbonate ions: Introduce a 
            source of carbonate ions to the calcium chloride 
            solution. This can be achieved by adding sodium 
            carbonate (Na2CO3) or sodium bicarbonate 
            (NaHCO3) to the solution. The carbonate ions from 
            these compounds will react with the calcium ions in 
            the solution, forming calcium carbonate.
            Step 3 Precipitation of calcium carbonate: A white 
            precipitate of calcium carbonate will form as a 
            result of the reaction between the calcium ions and 
            carbonate ions. The reaction can be written as 
            follows:
            Ca2+ (aq) + CO3^2- (aq) → CaCO3 (s)
            The solid calcium carbonate will precipitate out of 
            the solution.
            Step 4 Filtration and washing: Use filtration to 
            separate the solid calcium carbonate from the 
            liquid solution. Set up a filter paper in a funnel and 
            pour the mixture through it. The calcium carbonate 
            will be retained on the filter paper while the liquid, 
            containing any remaining calcium chloride and

        <div class="answer hidden">
            Iron (Fe):
               i. With Dilute H₂SO₄: Iron reacts with dilute sulfuric acid to produce iron(II) sulfate, hydrogen gas, and water. The chemical equation for this reaction is:
               \[ \text{Fe} + \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 \rightarrow \text{FeSO}_4 + \text{H}_2 \uparrow \]
               Iron(II) sulfate is a greenish solid that dissolves in water.
               
               ii. With Dilute HNO₃: Iron reacts with dilute nitric acid to produce iron(II) nitrate, nitrogen dioxide gas, and water. The chemical equation for this reaction is:
               \[ \text{Fe} + 2\text{HNO}_3 \rightarrow \text{Fe(NO}_3\text{)}_2 + \text{NO}_2 \uparrow + \text{H}_2\text{O} \]
            
            Aluminum (Al):
               i. With Dilute H₂SO₄: Aluminum reacts with dilute sulfuric acid to produce aluminum sulfate, hydrogen gas, and water. The chemical equation for this reaction is:
               \[ 2\text{Al} + 3\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 \rightarrow \text{Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3 + 3\text{H}_2 \uparrow \]
               Aluminum sulfate is a white solid that dissolves in water.
               
               ii. With Dilute HNO₃: Aluminum reacts with dilute nitric acid to produce aluminum nitrate, nitrogen dioxide gas, and water. The chemical equation for this reaction is:
               \[ 2\text{Al} + 6\text{HNO}_3 \rightarrow 2\text{Al(NO}_3\text{)}_3 + 3\text{NO}_2 \uparrow + 3\text{H}_2\text{O} \]
            
            In both cases, the hydrogen gas produced in the reactions is a result of the displacement of hydrogen ions (H⁺) from the acids by the more reactive metals (iron or aluminum). Additionally, the formation of nitrogen dioxide gas in the reactions with nitric acid is due to the oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) produced initially.</div>

    <button>Explanation</button>
    <div class="answer hidden">
 i. Equation for the burning of sulfur in air:
           \[ \text{S} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{SO}_2 \]
           When sulfur burns in air, it reacts with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide.
        
        ii. Catalyst used in the contact process: The catalyst used in the contact process is vanadium(V) oxide (V₂O₅).
        
        iii. Why an excess air is used in the contact process: Excess air is used in the contact process to ensure that there is enough oxygen present for the complete combustion of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide. This maximizes the yield of sulfur trioxide, which is the desired product of the process.
        
        iv. Why it is necessary to cool the catalyst used in the contact process: Cooling the catalyst used in the contact process is necessary to prevent it from overheating, which can lead to thermal decomposition or other unwanted side reactions. Cooling helps maintain the stability and effectiveness of the catalyst.
        
        v. Reason why the air used in the contact process needs to be as clean as possible: Clean air is important in the contact process because impurities in the air can potentially contaminate the catalyst or interfere with the reaction, reducing its efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore, clean air ensures optimal conditions for the reaction to occur.
        
        vi. Reasons why SO₂ should not be discharged into the atmosphere:
           1. **Air Pollution:** SO₂ is a major contributor to air pollution and can lead to the formation of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) in the atmosphere, which contributes to acid rain. Acid rain can harm the environment, ecosystems, and infrastructure.
           2. **Health Concerns:** SO₂ can cause respiratory problems, aggravate existing lung diseases such as asthma, and contribute to other health issues. It is classified as a harmful air pollutant by environmental agencies due to its detrimental effects on human health and well-being.</div>

    <button>Explanation</button>
    <div class="answer hidden">(i) Reagents used are KMnO<sub>4</sub> and concentrated HCl
        Condition: Crystals of KMnO<sub>4</sub> are placed in a flat bottomed flask, and moderately concentrated HCL is added drop by drop, through a dropping funnel. Heat is not required.
       - pure and dry sample of gas is obtained by pass it through water.
       - it is collected by downward elivery - since it is heavier than air.
    (ii) a. Chlorine is widely used to disinfect and purify water supplies. It effectively kills bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens present in water, making it safe for drinking and other domestic, industrial, and recreational purposes.
        b. Chlorine is a key raw material in the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), one of the most widely used plastics in the world. PVC is used in various applications including construction materials, pipes, packaging, electrical insulation, and medical devices.</div>

    I. hydrogen;		II. Sulphur (IV) oxide	III. Ammonia

ii. 	State the component of the following alloys
I. bronze	II. Brass.
</p>
    <div class="">
       <!--nonehere-->
    </div>
    <button>Explanation</button>
    <div class="answer hidden">(i) I. Hydrogen: Calcium chloride (CaCl₂) or phosphorus pentoxide (P₂O₅) can be used as drying agents for hydrogen gas. These substances absorb moisture effectively, ensuring that the hydrogen gas remains dry.
        II. Sulfur (IV) oxide (SO₂): Sulfur (IV) oxide can be dried using anhydrous calcium sulfate (CaSO₄), also known as Drierite. Calcium sulfate absorbs water vapor, leaving the sulfur dioxide gas dry.
  III. Ammonia (NH₃): Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or calcium oxide (CaO) can be used as drying agents for ammonia gas. These drying agents react with water vapor, removing moisture from the ammonia gas.
  (ii) I. Bronze: Bronze is primarily composed of copper (Cu) and tin (Sn). The proportion of tin can vary, typically ranging from around 5% to 25%, depending on the desired properties of the alloy. Small amounts of other elements may also be present, such as aluminum, silicon, or phosphorus, which can influence the properties of the bronze alloy.
II. Brass: Brass is mainly composed of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn). The proportion of zinc in brass varies, typically ranging from around 5% to 45%, depending on the desired characteristics of the alloy. Sometimes, other elements such as aluminum, lead, or tin may also be added in small amounts to modify specific properties of the brass alloy.
