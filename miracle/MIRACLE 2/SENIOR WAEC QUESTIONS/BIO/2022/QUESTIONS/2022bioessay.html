            <div class="answer hidden">3a(i) What is an ecological niche?
                An ecological niche is the role that a species plays in its environment. It includes the species' physical requirements, such as its habitat and food sources, as well as its interactions with other species.
                
                3a(ii) State five roles played by a mango tree in its ecological niche.
                Food source: The mango tree provides food for a variety of animals, including humans, monkeys, and bats.
                Habitat: The mango tree provides shelter for a variety of animals, including birds, insects, and reptiles.
                Pollinator: The mango tree is pollinated by bees, butterflies, and other insects.
                Water filter: The mango tree's roots help to filter water, making it cleaner for other plants and animals to use.
                Carbon sink: The mango tree absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</div>

<p>(b)	(i) State two reasons why ecologists use sampling techniques in population studies.

    (ii) State four examples of sampling techniques used in population studies.</p>

<div class="">
    <!--nonehere-->

</div>
<button>Explanation</button>
<div class="answer hidden">(3b)(i) To save time and money: Sampling techniques allow ecologists to study a small number of individuals from a population and make inferences about the entire population.
    To reduce the impact of human disturbance: Sampling techniques can help to reduce the impact of human disturbance on a population, such as by avoiding the need to capture and mark individuals.
    
    
    3b(ii) Quadrat sampling: This technique involves dividing the study area into a grid of squares and counting the number of individuals in each square.
    Line transect sampling: This technique involves walking along a straight line and counting the number of individuals that cross the line.
    Point sampling: This technique involves randomly placing points in the study area and counting the number of individuals that are within a certain distance of each point.
    Canopy cover sampling: This technique involves measuring the amount of sunlight that reaches the ground in different parts of the study area. This can be used to estimate the density of trees in the area.</div>

<p>(c)	Name four types of fingerprints in humans</p> 
<div class=""></div>
   <!--nonehere-->
</div>
<button>Explanation</button>
<div class="answer hidden">Arches: Arches are the most common type of fingerprint. They are characterized by smooth, curved ridges.
    Loops: Loops are the second most common type of fingerprint. They are characterized by ridges that form a loop shape.
    Whorls: Whorls are the least common type of fingerprint. They are characterized by ridges that form a spiral shape.
    Combinations: Combinations are fingerprints that have a mixture of arch, loop, and whorl patterns.</div>

<p>(d) 	(i) 	Name the plant used by Gregor Mendel in his experiment.

    (ii) 	State two reasons why the plant named in 3(d)(1) was used.</p>
<button>Explanation</button>
<div class="answer hidden">Gregor Mendel used the garden pea (Pisum sativum) in his experiment. The garden pea is a relatively simple plant with a short life cycle, which made it ideal for Mendel's experiments.

    3(d)(ii) The garden pea has a relatively simple genetic makeup. This made it easier for Mendel to track the inheritance of traits in the pea plants.
    The garden pea has a short life cycle. This allowed Mendel to conduct multiple generations of experiments in a relatively short period of time.

<p>4.	(a)	(i) What are conservation laws?

    (ii) State three conservation laws.	 </p>
<div class="">
   <!--nonehere-->
</div>
<button>Explanation</button>
<div class="answer hidden">Conservation laws are laws that protect plants and animals from being hunted, killed, or destroyed. They are designed to ensure that these living things are not overexploited and that their populations can continue to thrive.

    4a(ii) The Endangered Species Act (ESA): This law protects plants and animals that are in danger of extinction.
    The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA): This law protects marine mammals, such as whales, dolphins, and seals.
    The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA): This law protects bald and golden eagles, as well as their nests and eggs.</div>

<div class="">
   <!--nonehere-->
</div>
<button>Explanation</button>
<div class="answer hidden">4b. (i). For their body parts: Some animals are poached for their body parts, such as their fur, ivory, or meat. These body parts are often used in traditional Chinese medicine or sold as souvenirs.
    For their sport: Some people poach animals for the thrill of the hunt. They do not need the animal's body parts, but they enjoy the challenge of killing it.
    
    4b. (ii).Rhinoceroses: Rhinoceroses are poached for their horns, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine.
    Elephants: Elephants are poached for their ivory tusks, which are used to make jewelry and other decorative objects.
    Tigers: Tigers are poached for their fur and bones, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine.
    Leopards: Leopards are poached for their fur, which is used to make coats and other clothing items.
    Giraffes: Giraffes are poached for their meat, which is considered a delicacy in some cultures.</div>

<p>(c) State four effects of excessive use of the forest</p>
<div class="">
    <!--nonehere-->
 </div>
 <button>Explanation</button>
    <div class="answer hidden">Deforestation: Excessive use of the forest can lead to deforestation, which is the clearing of trees from an area. This can have a number of negative consequences, such as soil erosion, flooding, and climate change.
        Loss of biodiversity: The forest is home to a wide variety of plants and animals. Excessive use of the forest can lead to the loss of biodiversity, which is the variety of life on Earth.
        Water pollution: The forest helps to purify water by filtering out pollutants. Excessive use of the forest can lead to water pollution, which can make water unsafe to drink or use for other purposes.
        Climate change: The forest helps to regulate the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide. Excessive use of the forest can lead to climate change, which can have a number of negative consequences, such as more extreme weather events.
