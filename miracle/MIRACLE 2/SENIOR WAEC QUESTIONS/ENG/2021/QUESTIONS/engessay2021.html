Dear Agtguru
Yesterday only I returned from Bombay where I had gone for an excursion with my school mates. I was ever so excited about the experience that I have just decided to pen it all to you.

We were forty boys all together, and all of us were from Std. IX. The class planned an outing to Bombay because most of us had not seen the town. The trip was for a total of fifteen days in which we had to cover both Bombay and Goa. It was real great fun more so because most of us had the opportunity of seeing both these places for the first time.

We left Delhi on the 10th of October by the train August Kranti, and were in Bombay on the 11th morning. With us there were four teachers also. Here in Bombay arrangements had been made in the hostel of a school for our stay. All of us, the teachers and the children were all put up in the hostel. The very first sight of the town gave me the impression of being neat, clean and above all disciplined very unlike our Delhi. Inspite of an overpopulated town and very busy public, there is obvious discipline in the town; we could see it all in the public places where we went.

I was absolutely fascinated at the sight of double deckers the moving double storeyed buses that run there. The local trains are also very good and regular there, a very convenient mode of travel to distances. Oh, what loads of passengers these trains carry for long distances? I wish Delhi could have such a mode of travel in the town it would ease the situation of traffic to a very great extent

While in Bombay, every day we used to go out in the morning after breakfast and return at night. The places we saw there were the Museum, the Zoo, Juhu Beach, Chowpatty, Marine Drive and the Gateway of India, besides many other tourist resorts in Bombay. The best of all was the Marine Drive, a beautiful location with an expanse of water in the centre encircled with massive concrete tall buildings, Oh! What a sight especially in the evening when the lights of the town around the water throw their lights in the water it looks just fabulous. This visit of Bombay has been a real treat, and I would love to go again to see more of it, and know it better.

After a week in the city, we went to Goa. This place is also known to be a haven for tourists. This place does not have so much of a variety of places to see like Bombay has. Goa is mostly known for its beaches. Here we had to stay in a hotel, as here the hotels are not too expensive as in other places of the country. In Goa we saw a few beaches only as here our stay was for only two days.

The excursion was really wonderful and experience to treasure as, this was the first time I went out with my friends and teachers and that also to Bombay. We saw two new towns both being of name and fame for tourists. The enjoyment was just doubled by the company and togetherness of all of us friends and our teachers. Here, the teachers were also more of friends and so we enjoyed their presence with us. From Goa we returned to Delhi and reached here yesterday. I was so excited that, within a day of my arrival home I decided to share my experience with you by penning it to you. Now, for at least two or three days, the excursion fever will reign over me and only after that, I will be able to get back to my studies. How I wish you could also have accompanied us, I am sure you would have enjoyed it all.

All else is fine here. Convey my regards to your parents.</div>

    <p> 2. 	Several articles have been published on the alarming rate of indiscipline among the youth of your country. Write your contribution </p> <

            <button>Explanation</button>
            <div class="answer hidden">The Chairman. President and worthy members of the prominent youths' club, distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen. I am very happy to be among you this afternoon I was highly honoured when I was asked to come and deliver this talk on the rightly chosen topic: 'Indiscipline Among Youths.
                There is no other appropriate time for this topic than now when the whole country is sinking under the heavy yoke of indiscipline. Indiscipline is any action. utterances and societal behaviour that run contrary to the norms, customs, laws and conventions of the society. It is prevalent among youths who often channel their youthful energy and agility towards actions and behavioural patterns which negate the rightful societal norms, actions and behavioural expectations.
                Flagrantly, youths disrespect elders and constituted authorities They indulge in criminal activities like frauds, popularly known as 419, forgery, violent assassinations, robbery. violent demonstrations, prostitution and other forms of indiscipline.
                Why are our youths so much involved in indiscipline? This is a serious question that should agitate the minds of every meaningful Nigerian. Mr. Chairman. and Ladies and Gentlemen. the reasons are not far fetched. Indiscipline starts from the home. It is obvious today that many parents fail to find time to train their children. Parents abandon their wards to nannies when they are babies and to teachers in the schools when they grow up to school age. As a result of the economic depression in the country, parents who should be taking care of the children go out very early in the morning to come back late. It causes indiscipline among youths in the sense that parents no longer have time for their children. They usually go out early in the morning and come back late in the night. Some parents are drunkards and cocaine addicts. What moral lesson will such parents give to their children?
                Peer group influence is another factor responsible for the decline in discipline among our youths. There is truism in the biblical saying that bad company corrupts good manners. Some youths are greatly influenced by their bad friends. They easily join their mates who smoke Indian hemp. sniff cocaine and do some other horrible things. Female youths easily go into prostitution so as to augment the income they can get from their. parents.
                Similarly, societal influence has caused a decline in the level of discipline in our society. Our society encourages indiscipline. Nigerians worship money and those who acquire. material wealth by crooked means are praised instead of being treated with scorn. It is the belief of most youths that it is a great sin to be poor in the country and that they must have wealth by all means. This has made them to embrace all sorts of evils like bribery, embezzlement, fraud and forgery which, they believe, bring money.
                However, can the situation be altered? What future do our youths have? I still believe that there must be a way out. After all, when there is life, there is hope. This means that if we want to eradicate indiscipline among our youths, all hands must be on deck. The home which is the nucleus of the society and the government must be ready and committed to inculcate discipline in our youths. I want to use this opportunity to advise all parents to spare time to train their children and teach them moral lessons. Parents should also give them sound education because the youths are the leaders of tomorrow. The future of our country depends on how well we train our children.
                In addition, our churches and mosques have a lot of work to do in this matter They should be the epitome of good manners and they should give moral lessons to encourage our youths to be of good behaviour.
                Finally. the society should always praise and reward hardwork, exemplary display of discipline, honesty and other good virtues. Indisciplined youths, drug peddlers, fraudsters and robbers should be reprimanded and treated with scorn When we implement these suggestions, we would have been on the way to achieving a disciplined society.</div>

            <div class="answer hidden">Better late than never
                This is a story about an old man who lived in a village. He had two sons and one daughter. They were all well settled in their city life. His children would send him money every month so that he did not have any crisis. They also used to send letters to know about his well being.
                Once in a year his sons and daughter would come to pay a visit to him but for the rest of the year his only source of communication was the letters. sometimes he would go to the post master of the village to read the letters for him because he did not know to read and write. The postmaster always used to help the old man reading and writing the letters for him.
                But unfortunately that post master died and a young postmaster got appointed. That young postmaster was a rude person who did not want to help the man. Slowly his way of communication with his children got cut off. He use to remain very upset.
                 One day the head master of the village school came to him and asked about his disappointment. The old man told him that because of his being illiterate he is facing trouble to get in touch with his children. He described how he never went to school because of his commitments towards his family. After listening to the his problem, the head master gave him a solution that instead of asking help from others he should once again start going to school and read and write.
                The old man said everybody would laugh at him at this age studying. The headmaster told is better late than never. So following his advice the man joined the night school and started reading and writing. within few months he started writing letters to his children and getting their answers too. By then he did not have to go to anyone to read the letter. That day he was clear on the proverb that better late than never.</div>

            <p> 6. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it.

                As I sat down to relax  after a hard day’s work as a radio broadcaster, my attention was immediately arrested by what I saw on the television. There was my old classmate. Funke Jacob, introduce as Mrs. Funke Ajayi. Evidently, she must have married since we parted some fifteen years earlier. She looked as smart as she did when we were both secondary school students. Though age and childbearing had taken their toll.
                
                As I watched and listened, I realized that Funke was still her old self. I recalled how several years ago when we were directed by the English Language master to write an essay on “The Profession of My Dream”, each of us opted for and defended our choice as future teachers, doctors, engineers, accountants and the like. I chose to be a newscaster, and that was what I eventually became. Funke alone decided on a totally different direction. She opted to be a farmer. Shocked by her choice, the teacher summoned her to the front of the class to ready her essay. Ever confident and charming, she did. As we listed, most of us laughed, believing that she must be joking. After her presentation, the teacher agreed adding that it must be just an academic exercise. But Funke insisted she was as serious as any of us in her choices.
                
                I thought her academic brilliance, she was among the very best in most schools subjects. She was from a well-to-do family, so her parents should have no problem seeing her through tertiary education in acquire one of the “noble” professions. She had a good looks, the type you would associate with an office chief executive. Not with the farm. So, why farming? But farming was her choice, and into farming she went. What I did not know, which the interview brought to light, was that she indeed studies Agriculture in the university, had three children, and secured the support of a bank that loaned her some money which shad since refunded.
                
                Now, she has become a successful farmer, successful enough to have won the award for the most accomplished farmer of the year in the country. As the interviewer reveals. Funke is into crop farming. Animal rearing and fruit cultivation. She is also into planting and processing of rice. Her plantations cover more than five hundred hectares, which are worked with several machines like planters, harrowers, harvesters and insecticide sprayers.
                
                Here I am, struggling to keep my ageing ear alive, while Farmer Funke has become an employer of three hundred hands. I am no longer laughing.
                
               <p> (a) 	What was the common link between Funke and the writer?</p>
               <p> (b) 	Why did the writer think that Funke would not go into farming?</p>

            <p> 7. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it.

                Rarely can one find any African dish without tomato. It is an important ingredient in the preparation of rice, beans and many varieties of stews and soups. Although there are many types of tomatoes, the one preferred by most people are think, fleshy and virtually seedless. A few years ago many homes do not buy this essential commodity because it was unaffordable. It become so scarce that even not available, it was sold at an exorbitant price. Many had to resort to using the canned tomato paste. However, it was not tomato alone that was unaffordable, other food items were also out of reach of the common person. A number of reason were identified as the cause of this disturbing situation.
                
                Expert identified tutu absoluta as the disease that affected many tomato farms. This caused massive destruction to the crop and resulted in scarcity. Surprisingly, tomato was not the only crop that was plagued by disease; maize was also attacked by a disease caused by a ravaging arm of moth-like flies that eat up the leaves and suck up the tender corn while still in the cob. They are called army worms. This disease also affected other grains like sorghum, millet and wheat resulting in wide-spread scarcity.
                
                Farmer usually rely on wholesalers to buy off their farm produce. The wholesalers rely largely on transporters who charge exorbitantly to render their services. The high cost of evacuating the product continues to make it scarce and expensive. Transporter blame the exorbitant charges on high cost of fuel and vehicular maintenance due to bad roads. This cost is eventually transferred to the produce and borne by the consumers, many of whom are unable to afford it.
                
                Farmer do not have access to storage facilities, so they are unable to preserve their harvest, while awaiting the arrival of buyers, Unfortunately, a lot of the farm produce is eventually trashed as it spoils on the farms. This is particularly disheartening, considering that not enough is produced for the consumption of the populace in the first place. Ultimately, the farmer calculates the total cost of planting for the year on whatever is left to be sold.
                
                The problems are, however, not insurmountable especially because they have been identified. Governments have an important role to play which they cannot abdicate to the citizenry. For far to long, farming has depended on manual labor. In order to increase as well as guarantee greater harvest, governments must encourage and support mechanized farming. Waste would be reduced to the barest minimum if storage facilities were available, therefore, the provision of storage facilities is pertinent. Governments should also educate farmers on modern farming practice including the use of necessary insecticides at the appropriate time. Certainly, these steps will bring some succor to the lingering food crisis on the continent.
