        </br>
        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> The correct answer is:

            B. Helps in the utilization of scarce resources.
            
            Explanation:
            
            Economics is fundamentally concerned with how societies manage scarce resources to meet their needs and wants. It studies how resources like land, labor, and capital are used to produce goods and services and how these are distributed among individuals. Since resources are limited, economics focuses on maximizing their efficiency and effectiveness to address scarcity and make informed decisions.</div></br>

        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
A. Enables individuals to satisfy all their wants: Economics acknowledges that resources are limited, so it does not promise that all wants can be satisfied. Instead, it deals with how to make the best use of limited resources to address needs and prioritize wants.
</br>


        </div></br>
        Also,
        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
C. Helps producers to know what to produce: While economics does provide insights into demand and supply which can guide producers, it does not directly instruct what to produce. The decision on what to produce is influenced by market signals, consumer preferences, and other factors.
</div>
        </br>
        And lastly,
        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
D. Restores equilibrium between producers and consumers: Economics studies market equilibrium, but it does not restore it. It analyzes how markets reach equilibrium and the conditions under which it can be disrupted or restored, rather than actively engaging in restoring equilibrium. </div>

    <div id="more-content" class="hidden">
        </br>
        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> To determine the opportunity cost of buying the pair of shoes, you need to understand what you have to give up in order to acquire them. In this scenario:

            Cost of Pair of Shoes: $10
            Available Budget: $10
            Given the budget of $10 and the cost of the shoes being $10, purchasing the shoes means you can't afford any other items. Here’s the breakdown:
            
            Dress: $20
            Handbag: $7
            Jewellery: $3
            If you spend $10 on shoes, you lose the opportunity to buy the dress, which costs more than your entire budget, and also the handbag and jewellery, which combined cost $10 ($7 + $3). Therefore, you forego the ability to buy the dress and the jewellery.</div></br>

            <img src="/

A. Dress: This option is incorrect because the dress is not affordable with the remaining budget after purchasing shoes. It’s not just the dress you miss out on but also the jewellery.

        </br>
        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> Risk-bearing: Entrepreneurs are typically characterized by their willingness to take on risks. This is because starting and running a business involves uncertainty and potential financial losses. Entrepreneurs often invest their own resources and take personal and financial risks to pursue their business ideas. This willingness to take on risk distinguishes them from other roles within a business.</div></br>

        </br>
        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> When a commodity market operates without government interference, the distribution of commodities is determined by the price mechanism. This system allows supply and demand to interact freely, setting prices based on how much consumers are willing to pay and how much producers are willing to supply. The price mechanism helps allocate resources efficiently by signaling producers and consumers when to adjust their behaviors based on the scarcity or abundance of goods.</div></br>

        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
A. Government distribution agencies: This option is incorrect because government distribution agencies are involved when there is government interference. In a free market without government involvement, commodities are not distributed by such agencies.

            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
C. A central planning committee: This option is incorrect because a central planning committee is typically associated with a command economy or centrally planned economy, where the government or a central authority makes decisions about the allocation of resources. In a free market, there is no central authority planning the distribution of commodities.
</div>
        </br>

" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
D. Retailers only: While retailers play a role in the distribution of commodities, they are not the sole mechanism by which distribution occurs in a free market. The price mechanism encompasses the broader process through which supply and demand interact to determine prices and distribution, involving various market participants beyond just retailers.</div>

            1. Fairly Elastic (Correct Answer):
            When supply is fairly elastic, a change in price leads to a more than proportional change in the quantity supplied.
            The price increased by 100% (from $10 to $20), while the quantity supplied increased by 140% (from 50 to 120 boxes). The quantity supplied increased more than the price, indicating that the supply is fairly elastic.</div></br>

Option A (Incorrect): Unitary Elastic (Incorrect):
Unitary elasticity means that the percentage change in quantity supplied is exactly equal to the percentage change in price.
In this case, the percentage change in quantity supplied (140%) is greater than the percentage change in price (100%), so the supply is not unitary elastic.

Option B (Incorrect):  Perfectly Inelastic (Incorrect):
Perfectly inelastic supply means that the quantity supplied does not change at all when the price changes.
Here, the quantity supplied increased significantly (from 50 to 120 boxes) when the price doubled, so the supply is not perfectly inelastic.

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> B. A decrease in supply (Correct): A leftward shift in the supply curve indicates that at every price level, the quantity supplied has decreased. This could be due to various factors such as increased production costs, a decrease in the number of producers, or new regulations that limit production. This is the correct interpretation of a leftward shift in the supply curve.</div></br>

A. An increase in quantity supplied: This would typically correspond to a movement along the supply curve to the right, not a shift of the curve itself. An increase in quantity supplied occurs when the price of the commodity increases, causing producers to supply more of it at the higher price, but this does not shift the supply curve.

C. A reduction in quantity supplied: This answer is partly correct but misleading. A reduction in quantity supplied would occur along the supply curve due to a decrease in the price of the commodity, not a shift of the entire curve. The leftward shift represents a decrease in supply, not just a reduction in quantity at a single price point.

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> A. Price of the product (Correct)

            When the price of a product increases, producers are generally more willing to supply more of the product because they can earn higher revenue. This is due to the law of supply, which states that there is a direct relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied.</div></br>

B. Prices of factors of production (Incorrect)

An increase in the prices of factors of production (such as labor, raw materials, etc.) would actually decrease supply. This is because higher production costs make it less profitable for producers to supply the same quantity of goods, leading to a decrease in market supply.

C. Tax paid on raw materials (Incorrect)

If taxes on raw materials increase, the cost of production also increases, which can lead to a decrease in supply. Producers might reduce the quantity they supply to the market because the higher costs reduce their profit margins.

D. Subsidies on raw materials (Incorrect)

Subsidies on raw materials reduce production costs, which can lead to an increase in supply. However, the question asks what happens when there is an increase, and an increase in subsidies would typically result in an increase in supply, but the focus is on price in this context. Hence, this option does not directly answer the question about the product price's impact on supply. </div>

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> C. Encouraging them to produce surplus output (Correct):
            When farmers are encouraged to produce more than what is needed for immediate consumption (surplus output), they can sell the excess in the market. This increased supply can lead to more income for the farmers, especially if the market demand is strong. Additionally, producing surplus can allow farmers to export their products or store them for future sales when prices might be higher, thus stabilizing their income over time.</div></br>

A. Fixing maximum prices (Incorrect):

Fixing maximum prices means setting a ceiling on the price that can be charged for goods. This is typically done to protect consumers, not producers. For farmers, this can be harmful because it limits the amount they can earn from their products, reducing their potential income.

" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
B. Fixing minimum prices (Incorrect):

Fixing minimum prices can help to ensure that farmers receive a baseline income for their products, but it doesn't directly lead to an increase in income. If the minimum price is set too high, it can lead to excess supply, which might go unsold, or it might distort the market, leading to inefficiencies and possible waste.

            Why B is Correct:
            Price Falls: An increase in supply, assuming demand remains constant, will lead to a surplus of goods at the original equilibrium price. To eliminate this surplus, the price must fall until the surplus is eliminated.
            Quantity Rises: As the price falls, consumers are encouraged to buy more, leading to an increase in the quantity demanded. At the new equilibrium, more goods are sold at a lower price.</div></br>

            A. fixed inputs of production: This is the correct answer because the law of diminishing returns applies when one input (e.g., land, machinery) is fixed. As more variable inputs (like labor) are added, the efficiency of production decreases after a certain point.</div></br>

            Average Cost
            =

            Quantity of Output

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> B. MR slopes down to the right and is below the AR curve (Correct):
            In a monopoly, the average revenue (AR) curve represents the demand curve, which is downward sloping because the monopolist must lower the price to sell more units.
            The marginal revenue (MR) is the additional revenue gained from selling one more unit. For a monopolist, MR is always less than AR because to sell an additional unit, the monopolist must reduce the price, which reduces the revenue gained from all previous units sold at the higher price. Thus, the MR curve lies below the AR curve and also slopes downward.</div></br>

D. MR is vertical while the AR curve is horizontal (Incorrect):

This is incorrect because neither the MR curve nor the AR curve is vertical or horizontal. The AR curve is downward sloping, and the MR curve is also downward sloping but lies below the AR curve. Vertical or horizontal curves would not represent the relationship between MR and AR in a monopoly.

            A subvention is a form of financial support provided by the government. In many West African countries, railway corporations are often government-owned or heavily subsidized by the government to ensure they can operate efficiently. Given the high cost of maintaining railway infrastructure and operations, government subvention is a crucial and reliable source of funding.

Sale of Shares (Incorrect):

Selling shares is a method of raising capital for private or publicly traded companies. However, in most West African countries, railway corporations are typically state-owned enterprises rather than publicly traded companies. Therefore, selling shares is not a common or major source of finance for these entities.

Trade Credit (Incorrect):

Trade credit refers to an arrangement where a supplier allows a company to purchase goods or services and pay for them later. While useful for short-term operational needs, it is not a significant or sustainable source of finance for large, capital-intensive projects like railways.

Surplus (Incorrect):

Surplus refers to the excess of income over expenditure. While it can be a source of funds if the corporation is profitable, it is not a primary or consistent source of finance. Railway corporations in West Africa often operate at a loss or with minimal surplus, relying instead on government support.</div>

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> A. a problem of unemployment of labour (Correct):

            Middlemen, such as wholesalers, retailers, and distributors, play a crucial role in the chain of distribution. If manufacturers or producers bypass these middlemen to sell directly to consumers, the middlemen might lose their jobs, leading to unemployment. This option is correct because removing middlemen directly impacts the jobs they provide, contributing to unemployment in those sectors.</div></br>

            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
B. the creation of artificial scarcity (Incorrect):

Bypassing middlemen typically aims to make goods more accessible to consumers, not create scarcity. Middlemen are often responsible for distribution and warehousing, but if producers handle these functions directly, scarcity is less likely to occur. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
C. high prices of goods and services (Incorrect):

The involvement of middlemen often adds to the cost of goods due to their markups. Bypassing them can potentially reduce these costs, leading to lower prices, not higher ones. This option is incorrect because the removal of middlemen usually decreases the cost to the final consumer.

</div>

D. an increase in government tax revenue (Incorrect):

The removal of middlemen does not directly correlate with an increase in government tax revenue. Taxes are generally imposed on profits, sales, and incomes, and bypassing middlemen does not necessarily affect the government's tax collection in a significant way. This option is incorrect because bypassing middlemen does not inherently increase tax revenue. </div>

            Work environment: A positive and safe work environment can significantly enhance workers' efficiency. Factors like proper lighting, ventilation, ergonomic furniture, and overall workspace design contribute to employees' comfort and productivity.
            Health status of workers: Healthy workers are generally more productive. Good physical and mental health reduces absenteeism, increases energy levels, and improves concentration, all of which contribute to higher efficiency.</div></br>

A. population size and age of retirement (Incorrect)

Population size: While it might influence the labor market in terms of available workforce, it does not directly affect the efficiency of labor. Efficiency is more about how well workers perform their tasks rather than how many workers there are.
Age of retirement: The age at which workers retire doesn’t directly improve efficiency during their working years. It might impact the overall workforce demographics but not individual worker productivity.

B. school leaving age and number of disabled workers (Incorrect)

School leaving age: This could influence the skill level of new entrants to the workforce but doesn't directly improve efficiency. The efficiency of labor depends more on ongoing training, work conditions, and worker health.
Number of disabled workers: The number of disabled workers in the workforce doesn’t directly affect efficiency. Instead, providing a supportive environment for all workers, including those with disabilities, is crucial for maximizing their potential.

D. school leaving age and number of part-time workers (Incorrect)

School leaving age: Again, while it may affect when individuals enter the workforce, it doesn’t directly impact the efficiency of labor once they are employed.
Number of part-time workers: The proportion of part-time workers doesn’t directly improve efficiency. Efficiency is more about how effectively workers perform their tasks during their working hours, whether they are full-time or part-time.</div>

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> The dependency ratio is a measure of the number of dependents (people who are too young or too old to work) compared to the working-age population (those typically aged 16 to 60).

            Steps to Calculate the Dependency Ratio:
            Identify the dependent population:
            
            0-15 years: 30%
            Over 60 years: 10%
            Total dependent population = 30% + 10% = 40%
            Identify the working-age population:
            
            16-40 years: 45%
            41-60 years: 15%
            Total working-age population = 45% + 15% = 60%
            Calculate the dependency ratio:
            
            Dependency ratio = (Dependent Population / Working-Age Population)
            Dependency ratio = 40% / 60% = 2/3 = 1:1.5 ≈ 1:2
            Correct Answer:
            C. 1 : 2
            
            This is correct because the dependent population (40%) is approximately 2/3 of the working-age population (60%), which simplifies to a ratio of 1:2.</div></br>
        On the other hand,
        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
Option A: 2:3
This suggests the dependent population is 2/3 of the working-age population, which is close but not the simplified form of the actual ratio, which is 1:2.

            The correct answer is B. Government is able to participate and control the operation of the privatized businesses.
            
            Explanation:
            B is not an argument for the policy of privatization. Privatization involves transferring ownership and control of businesses or assets from the government to private entities. The core idea behind privatization is that private management will be more efficient and profitable than government management. Therefore, privatization aims to reduce government control and involvement in these businesses.</div></br>

C. Members of the public are able to acquire shares: This is also an argument for privatization. By selling shares to the public, privatization aims to make ownership more widespread and involve the public in the success of the business.
</div>
        </br>
        And lastly,

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> Calculate the Net National Product (NNP) at market prices:

            NNP at market prices = Gross Domestic Product (GDP) + Net Factor Income from Abroad - Depreciation
            Here, GDP = $2,800
            Net Factor Income from Abroad = $250

            NNP at market prices=2800+250−700=2350
            Calculate NNP at factor cost:
            
            NNP at factor cost = NNP at market prices - Indirect Taxes
            Here, Indirect Taxes = $120

            NNP at factor cost

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> Buying Treasury Bills: When the government buys treasury bills (a form of government debt) in the open market, it is engaging in open market operations. This action typically injects money into the economy, increasing the money supply. However, in a broader sense, buying these securities can also be part of a strategy to manage inflation by adjusting the amount of money in circulation. When inflation is high, the central bank might use these operations to tighten the money supply, countering inflationary pressures by reducing liquidity.</div></br>

A. Encouraging banks to lend for any purpose: Encouraging banks to lend freely increases the money supply, which can actually exacerbate inflation rather than curb it. More lending means more money circulating in the economy, which can lead to higher inflation.

D. Selling securities in the open market: Selling securities in the open market is a typical method used to reduce the money supply and curb inflation. This action takes money out of circulation as investors buy these securities, which can help reduce inflation. However, the question asks for the correct way to curb inflation, and since buying treasury bills might be part of a broader monetary policy strategy to influence inflation, the context of buying and selling securities can be nuanced. </div>

            A floating exchange rate system means that the value of a country's currency is determined by the open market through the forces of demand and supply relative to other currencies. This type of exchange rate fluctuates freely and is not set by any governmental or international authority. When there is a higher demand for a currency, its value increases; conversely, if there is less demand, its value decreases.</div></br>

A. Central bank of the country:

In a fixed exchange rate system, the central bank intervenes to maintain the currency's value at a specific level. However, in a floating exchange rate system, the central bank does not fix the exchange rate; it is determined by market forces.

            The financial account records transactions that involve the transfer of ownership of international financial assets. It includes transactions such as foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, and other investments (like loans). Since invisible trade refers to trade in services and other intangible assets, its financial transactions are often captured under the financial account.

Trade Account (Option A - Incorrect)

The trade account typically refers to the balance of trade, which records the export and import of goods (tangible items), not services or other intangible assets. Invisible trade, involving services, would not be recorded here.
</br>

" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
Capital Account (Option B - Incorrect)

The capital account records transfers of capital, such as debt forgiveness, international aid, or the transfer of assets by migrants. It deals with capital transfers and acquisition/disposal of non-produced, non-financial assets, rather than services or trade.

</div>
        </br>

Current Account (Option C - Incorrect)

The current account includes the trade in goods and services, income (like dividends and interest), and current transfers (like remittances). While the current account does record invisible trade (such as services), the specific financial transactions involved in invisible trade are more accurately recorded in the financial account. The distinction is that the financial account focuses on ownership changes and investments related to these trades.</div>

            Eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers between themselves to promote free trade within the group.
            Adopt a common external tariff on imports from non-member countries, meaning they all charge the same tariff rates on goods coming from outside the union.</div></br>

A. Free movement of factors of production: This is a characteristic of a common market rather than a customs union. A common market not only includes a customs union but also allows for the free movement of labor, capital, and other factors of production among member countries.

    <div id="more-content" class="hidden">
        </br>
        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> Correct Answer: C. Over-reliance on multiple commodities
            Developing countries with abundant natural resources often focus heavily on extracting and exporting these resources. This can lead to over-reliance on a few key commodities, making their economies vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices. When a country depends too much on these resources, it may neglect other sectors of the economy that could drive sustainable growth, such as manufacturing or services.</div></br>
        On the other hand,
        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
A. High rate of inflation

While inflation can be a problem for developing countries, it is not directly related to the failure of abundant natural resources to contribute to economic growth. Inflation affects purchasing power and economic stability but doesn't inherently impact the benefits of natural resource wealth.
</br>


        </div></br>

        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
B. Urban congestion

Urban congestion refers to problems related to overcrowding in cities, which is not directly connected to the economic impact of natural resources. While it can be a challenge for urban development, it doesn't address the fundamental issue of how resource abundance affects economic growth.
</div>
        </br>
        And lastly,
        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
D. Mismanagement and corruption

Mismanagement and corruption are indeed significant issues that can hinder the economic benefits of natural resources. However, the question specifically asks about why abundant natural resources do not contribute to economic growth, and over-reliance on multiple commodities is a broader issue that encompasses how mismanagement and corruption can also play a role. Mismanagement and corruption are specific issues that may result from or exacerbate the problems caused by over-reliance.</div>
