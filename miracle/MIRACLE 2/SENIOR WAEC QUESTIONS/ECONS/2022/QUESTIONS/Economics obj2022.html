        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> Scale of preference is an economic concept that refers to the ranking of needs and wants in order of priority. It helps consumers decide which goods and services to purchase first based on their importance. This concept is essential in making choices, especially when resources are limited.

            Option D (Correct): Consumers’ wants in order of priority - This is the correct answer because the scale of preference is essentially a list that prioritizes a consumer's wants. It helps in decision-making when faced with limited resources.

Option A: Incomes of consumers in order of size - This is incorrect because a scale of preference does not rank consumer incomes; instead, it ranks wants or needs based on importance or urgency.

Option B: Utilities enjoyed by consumers - This is incorrect because the scale of preference is not about the utilities or satisfaction derived from consuming goods but rather about prioritizing wants.

Option C: Opportunity cost of goods consumed - This is incorrect because the scale of preference is related to the prioritization of wants, not directly to the concept of opportunity cost, which refers to the next best alternative forgone when making a choice. </div>

    <div id="more-content" class="hidden">
        </br>
        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> A. Within the production possibility curve (Correct Answer):

            The production possibility curve (PPC) represents the maximum possible output combinations of two goods or services that can be produced with available resources and technology, assuming full and efficient use of those resources.
            If production is within the PPC, it indicates that the economy is not utilizing all available resources efficiently. This could be due to unemployment of labor, underutilization of capital, or other inefficiencies, leading to unemployment of resources.</div></br>

        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
B. Outside the production possibility curve (Incorrect):

Production outside the PPC is not possible with the current resources and technology. It represents a level of production that the economy cannot achieve unless there is an increase in resources or an improvement in technology. Therefore, it does not relate to unemployment of resources.
</br>


        </div></br>

        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
C. Along the production possibility curve (Incorrect):

Production along the PPC indicates that resources are being used efficiently and the economy is operating at its full potential. All resources are fully employed, so there is no unemployment of resources.
</div>
        </br>
        And lastly,
        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
D. Adequate to meet market demand (Incorrect):

This option is unrelated to the concept of the PPC. Meeting market demand depends on various factors such as consumer preferences, prices, and production decisions. It does not directly address whether resources are fully employed or not.</div>

    <div id="more-content" class="hidden">
        </br>
        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> Correct Answer (C. Are free gifts of nature):

            Natural resources are considered "free gifts of nature" because they exist in the environment without human intervention. Examples include water, air, minerals, and forests. These resources are provided by nature and are available for human use without any direct cost of creation.</div></br>

        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
A. Are unlimited in supply:

This is incorrect because natural resources are not unlimited. Many natural resources, like fossil fuels and minerals, are finite and can be exhausted if overused. Renewable resources like water and forests can also become scarce if not managed sustainably.
</br>


        </div></br>

            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
B. Have high cost of production:

This is incorrect because natural resources themselves do not have a cost of production. They are naturally occurring and do not require human effort to be produced. However, the extraction, processing, and transportation of these resources may involve costs.


</div>
        </br>

        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
D. Do not command any price:

This is incorrect because natural resources can command a price in the market. For example, oil, gold, and timber are sold at specific prices. The market value of these resources depends on their demand, availability, and the cost associated with extracting or refining them.</div>

        </br>
        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> D. Worsens income inequality among the citizens:

            A major disadvantage of a capitalist economy is that it often leads to significant income inequality. In a capitalist system, resources and wealth are typically concentrated in the hands of those who own capital (businesses, property, investments), while others who do not own capital, such as workers, may earn much less. This disparity can widen over time, leading to greater economic inequality</div></br>

            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
A. Leads to low production of goods and services:

This option is incorrect because a capitalist economy is typically characterized by high production of goods and services. The profit motive drives competition, which generally results in increased production and innovation to meet consumer demand.
</br>


        </div></br>

" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
B. Requires a large number of officials to operate:

This option is also incorrect. In fact, one of the features of a capitalist economy is that it tends to minimize government intervention. The market is largely driven by private individuals and businesses, rather than a large number of officials.
</div>
        </br>
        And lastly,
        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
C. Considers individual consumers' satisfaction:

This option is incorrect because considering individual consumer satisfaction is actually a strength, not a disadvantage, of a capitalist economy. Companies compete to attract customers by providing goods and services that meet consumer needs and desires, which can lead to higher levels of satisfaction. </div>

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> D. In competitive demand:

            Correct Answer: Competitive demand refers to the situation where two goods are substitutes for each other. An increase in the demand for one good typically leads to a decrease in the demand for the other because consumers will switch from one product to another if they find it more desirable or cheaper. For example, if the demand for tea increases, the demand for coffee might decrease if both are substitutes in the eyes of the consumer.</div></br>

" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
A. In complemented demand:

Incorrect: Complementary goods are goods that are typically used together, such as cars and gasoline. An increase in the demand for one usually leads to an increase in the demand for the other, not a decrease.

            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
B. Of the same quality:

Incorrect: The quality of the goods does not directly relate to the demand for one leading to a decrease in the demand for another. If two goods are of the same quality, they may be substitutes, but quality alone does not define the relationship between their demands.

            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
C. In composite demand:

Incorrect: Composite demand refers to a situation where a single good is demanded for multiple purposes. For example, crude oil is demanded for producing gasoline, plastics, and other products. An increase in the demand for one of its uses does not typically lead to a decrease in the demand for another use; rather, it might increase the overall demand for the good.</div>

        </br>
        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> Correct Answer (B. Positively sloped): The demand curve for goods of ostentation, also known as Veblen goods, is usually positively sloped. These are goods where the demand increases as the price increases because higher prices make them more desirable as status symbols. The higher the price, the more prestigious the item is perceived, which increases its demand among certain consumers.</div></br>

        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
A. Negatively sloped: A negatively sloped demand curve is typical for most goods, where demand decreases as the price increases. However, this does not apply to goods of ostentation, where higher prices can actually increase demand.

            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
C. Vertical: A vertical demand curve suggests that the quantity demanded does not change regardless of the price. This would imply that consumers buy the same quantity of the good no matter the price, which is not the case for Veblen goods.

            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
D. Horizontal: A horizontal demand curve would indicate that the price of the good does not change regardless of the quantity demanded, which is not applicable to Veblen goods. The demand for these goods is sensitive to changes in price, but in the opposite direction compared to normal goods.</div>

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> Income distribution (Correct Answer):

            Changes in income distribution affect the overall wealth and income levels within a society, but they do not directly cause changes in the demand for a specific product or commodity. This factor influences the purchasing power of different segments of the population but does not directly alter the quantity demanded of a particular good or service.

Taste and fashion (Incorrect):

Changes in consumer preferences, taste, and fashion directly influence demand. If a product becomes more fashionable or desirable, its demand will increase, and if it falls out of favor, the demand will decrease.

Price of the commodity (Incorrect):

The price of a commodity is one of the most significant factors that affect demand. Generally, if the price of a commodity rises, the demand for it tends to decrease (assuming it's a normal good), and if the price decreases, the demand usually increases.

The size of the population (Incorrect):

An increase in population size generally leads to an increase in demand for goods and services, as more people require more products. Conversely, a decrease in population size would likely reduce demand.</div>

A. There is an increase in taxes on inputs: An increase in taxes on inputs raises production costs for producers. Higher production costs generally decrease supply, shifting the supply curve to the left rather than to the right.

B. Government increases subsidies: While increasing subsidies can indeed increase supply, this option is somewhat misleading because it suggests government action rather than a direct change in market conditions. Increases in subsidies typically lead to a rightward shift in the supply curve, but the direct impact of rural-urban migration on labor supply and production is a more straightforward answer in this context.

            The correct answer is B. Is horizontal.
            
            Explanation:
            In perfectly elastic supply, the supply curve is horizontal. This means that the quantity supplied can increase or decrease without affecting the price. In other words, suppliers are willing to supply any amount of the good at a constant price. This characteristic defines perfectly elastic supply.</div></br>

            <img src="/

A. Is vertical: A vertical supply curve represents perfectly inelastic supply, where the quantity supplied remains constant regardless of price changes. This is not the case for perfectly elastic supply.

        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
C. Slopes upward: An upward-sloping supply curve represents positive elasticity of supply, where higher prices incentivize more supply. However, in perfectly elastic supply, the price remains constant, so the curve is horizontal, not upward-sloping.

            <img src="/

D. Slopes downward: A downward-sloping supply curve would indicate negative elasticity, where higher prices lead to a decrease in quantity supplied. This does not describe perfectly elastic supply.</div>

C. He can equate his marginal and total utilities: This is incorrect because marginal utility and total utility are different concepts. Marginal utility is the additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit of the good, while total utility is the overall satisfaction derived from consuming all units. Equating these two is not a condition for consumer equilibrium.

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> In economic theory, a firm is in equilibrium when it maximizes its profit. This occurs when:

            Marginal Cost (MC) equals Marginal Revenue (MR): This condition ensures that the cost of producing an additional unit of output is equal to the revenue it generates, thereby maximizing profit.
            
            Marginal Cost curve cuts the Marginal Revenue curve from below: This specific condition ensures that the firm is operating in the profit-maximizing region. If the MC curve were above the MR curve at the point of intersection, it would mean that producing more would increase costs more than revenue, leading to a decrease in profit. Conversely, if MC cuts MR from below, the firm is producing at a level where additional units are still profitable.</div></br>

Break the monopolies of private companies is correct because cooperative societies often aim to counteract the dominance of private companies by providing an alternative for members to access goods, services, and benefits.

        </br>
        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> Option B: Break bulk and sell products in small units – This is a major function of retailers. Retailers purchase large quantities of goods from wholesalers or manufacturers and then sell these goods in smaller quantities to individual consumers. This process is known as "breaking bulk."</div></br>

        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">

Option A: Grant credit to the Wholesaler – This is not a major function of a retailer. While some retailers may offer credit, it's not a primary role. Retailers typically focus on selling directly to consumers rather than dealing primarily with wholesalers.

A. An excessive budget deficit: A rapid population increase typically puts pressure on government resources, but it doesn't directly lead to an excessive budget deficit. An excessive budget deficit would usually result from poor financial management or spending beyond revenue, not solely from population growth.

D. A higher dependency ratio: This refers to the ratio of dependents (people who are not in the labor force) to the working-age population. A higher dependency ratio is typically a negative consequence of rapid population growth, as it means there are more people relying on fewer working-age individuals for support.</div>

It includes the value of output produced within the country and abroad by the residents.

            Net National Product (NNP): This is calculated by subtracting the depreciation (the provision for the wear and tear of assets) from the Gross National Product (GNP). Depreciation accounts for the loss in value of capital assets due to wear and tear over time. Thus,

Increased outflow of aid: This option is correct because if a country's national income increases but the population size is not effectively controlled, the per capita income might not rise proportionately. As a result, the country's economic growth may not translate into better living standards for its citizens. To address this imbalance, the country might have to rely more on external aid, leading to an increased outflow of aid to manage the growing population's needs.</div></br>

            When the Central Bank increases the bank rate (the interest rate at which it lends to commercial banks), borrowing becomes more expensive for these banks. As a result, commercial banks may increase their own interest rates on loans to customers, which can discourage borrowing. This reduction in borrowing can lead to a decrease in the overall money supply in the economy.</div></br>

Option A: Many banks will shut down their operations

An increase in the bank rate makes borrowing more expensive but does not directly lead to banks shutting down. Banks may face higher costs, but they usually adjust by increasing interest rates on loans to maintain profitability.

Option C (Only government expenditure to regulate an economy): Government expenditure is indeed a key part of fiscal policy, but focusing only on expenditure ignores the role of taxation. Fiscal policy includes both government spending and taxation to manage the economy.    </div>

        </br>
        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> Perfectly Inelastic Demand: When demand is perfectly inelastic, the quantity demanded does not change regardless of price changes. This means that consumers will continue to buy the same amount of the good or service even if the price rises due to a tax.

            Tax Incidence: In the case of perfectly inelastic demand, consumers are fully responsible for the tax burden. Since their quantity demanded remains unchanged no matter the price increase, they absorb the entire tax through higher prices. This is why the tax is borne only by the consumer.</div></br>

A. Is borne only by the producer: This is incorrect because in the case of perfectly inelastic demand, producers cannot shift the tax burden to consumers because consumers will not reduce their quantity demanded. Therefore, the tax burden cannot be borne by the producer in this scenario.

C. Will have greater impact on the seller: This is incorrect because with perfectly inelastic demand, the entire tax burden is passed on to the consumer. The seller's revenue does not change because the quantity sold remains constant, even though the price may rise.

A. Scares many people from politics: While political instability may deter some individuals from engaging in politics, this does not directly hinder economic growth.

A. Make imported goods affordable: This is contrary to the purpose of many commercial policies.

C. Encourage the importation of non-essential goods: This is incorrect because commercial policies are often designed to restrict the importation of certain goods, especially if they are seen as non-essential or if they pose a threat to local industries.

        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> In all forms of economic integration, one of the fundamental benefits is the increased mobility of factors of production. This includes labor, capital, and resources, which can move more freely across borders within the integrated area. This mobility enhances efficiency and can lead to more optimal allocation of resources.</div></br>

B. Common currency is in use: This benefit is specific to economic unions or monetary unions (e.g., the Eurozone) and is not present in all forms of economic integration. Other forms of integration, such as free trade areas or customs unions, do not necessarily involve a common currency.

C. Common agricultural policy is in place: A common agricultural policy is specific to certain types of economic integration, particularly in customs unions or economic unions with a shared agricultural policy (e.g., the European Union). It is not a universal feature of all economic integration models.

D. The size of the market is widened: While this is a benefit of economic integration, it is not a feature that is present in all forms of economic integration. Market size expansion is a result of the integration but is not inherent to all forms, such as those that do not involve trade expansion beyond existing markets. </div>

A. Promote free trade and development among members: While the AfDB does support development and economic growth, its primary function is not specifically to promote free trade among its members. Its role is more focused on providing financial assistance for projects.

B. Provide loans to finance balance of payments problems: The AfDB does not primarily focus on providing loans for balance of payments issues. This function is more characteristic of institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The AfDB's main role is to finance development projects rather than address balance of payments problems directly.

    <div class="answer hidden">The correct answer is Option C. May be limited to chemical industries.

    <div id="more-content" class="hidden">
        </br>
        <div id="subject-name" class="hidden"> C. May be limited to chemical industries: This is correct because if petrol is no longer needed for energy production, its primary use would shift. Crude oil, which is refined into petrol, is also a crucial raw material for various chemical products. Thus, demand for crude oil might still exist but would be confined mainly to sectors like chemical manufacturing.</div></br>
        On the other hand,
        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
A. Will increase: This is unlikely. If petrol is no longer used for energy, the overall demand for crude oil would likely decrease, not increase, because a significant portion of crude oil consumption is for energy.
</br>


        </div></br>
        Also,
        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
B. Will remain constant: This is also incorrect. With a major use of crude oil (petrol for energy) no longer needed, the overall demand for crude oil would likely change, not stay constant.
</div>
        </br>
        And lastly,
        <div style="width: 25vw; height: auto;">
            <img src="/
" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> </img>
D. Will make producing countries richer: This is not necessarily true. While crude oil-producing countries might see shifts in the global market, a decrease in demand for crude oil could actually have negative economic impacts on these countries, depending on how they diversify their economies and manage their resources.</div>
