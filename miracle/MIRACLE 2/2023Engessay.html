            <div class="answer hidden">Dear Editor,

                I am writing to express my concern about the lack of maintenance of public facilities in our community. I have noticed that many of our parks, playgrounds, and sidewalks are in disrepair. This is a serious problem that needs to be addressed.
                
                There are several reasons why it is important to maintain public facilities. First, they provide a safe and enjoyable space for people of all ages to use. Second, they help to improve the quality of life in our community. Third, they can boost property values.
                
                When public facilities are not maintained, they can become dangerous and unsightly. This can lead to people avoiding them, which can have a negative impact on our community. For example, if a park is not maintained, children may be less likely to play there, which can lead to obesity and other health problems.
                
                In addition, poorly maintained public facilities can be a liability for our community. If someone is injured on a broken sidewalk, the city could be held liable. This could lead to costly lawsuits.
                
                I urge you to use your platform to raise awareness of this issue. We need to make sure that our elected officials are aware of the importance of maintaining public facilities. We also need to let them know that we are willing to pay for this service.
                
                I believe that by working together, we can make our community a better place to live.
                
                Here are some specific examples of the lack of maintenance of public facilities in our community:
                
                The park near my house has a broken swing set and a hole in the fence.
                The sidewalk on my street is cracked and uneven.
                The playground at my child's school is littered with trash.
                These are just a few examples of the many public facilities that are in need of maintenance. I urge you to use your platform to raise awareness of this issue and to call on our elected officials to take action.
                
                Sincerely,

            <div class="answer hidden">Once upon a time in a small village nestled among rolling hills, there lived a kind-hearted farmer named Thomas. He worked tirelessly to provide for his family, cultivating his land with utmost care. However, the village had experienced a drought for several months, leaving the fields parched and barren. Thomas watched helplessly as his crops withered away, his hopes fading along with them.

                One morning, Thomas received news that a neighboring village had been blessed with rain and their fields were flourishing. Filled with determination, he decided to seek assistance from his prosperous neighbors. With a small sack slung over his shoulder, he set off on a long journey towards their village.
                
                Arriving tired and hungry, Thomas humbly explained his situation to the villagers. Moved by his plight, the villagers were willing to help but couldn't spare much due to their own needs. A kind farmer named Robert approached Thomas and offered him half a loaf of bread, apologizing for not being able to provide more.
                
                Thomas gratefully accepted the half loaf, understanding that half a loaf was better than none at all. With renewed energy, he set off on his return journey, cherishing the small hope that the half loaf represented. As he walked, he contemplated the saying, "Half a loaf is better than none," and realized its profound truth.
                
                Back in his village, Thomas shared the bread with his family. Though it was a modest portion, it brought nourishment and lifted their spirits. Inspired by the half loaf, Thomas devised a plan. He gathered his fellow farmers and proposed they pool their resources to combat the drought collectively. Though skeptical at first, the villagers agreed, realizing that half a loaf was better than none when faced with adversity.
                
                Together, they dug channels to redirect water from a distant river to their fields, implemented efficient irrigation techniques, and supported one another in their efforts. Despite the ongoing drought, the collective action yielded positive results. The crops began to grow, and hope returned to the hearts of the villagers.
                
                Word of their success spread, and neighboring villages sought guidance from Thomas and his fellow farmers. They willingly shared their knowledge and resources, emphasizing the power of unity and the importance of making the most of limited resources. As the villages banded together, the effects of the drought were mitigated, and the communities flourished.
                
                The saying, "Half a loaf is better than none," resonated throughout the region as a symbol of resilience and resourcefulness. It reminded people that even in the face of adversity, it was crucial to make the most of what they had, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem.
                
                Years later, the drought ended, and the villages thrived. Thomas, now regarded as a wise elder, continued to impart the lessons he learned from that half loaf of bread. He emphasized the importance of gratitude, humility, and the power of unity in overcoming challenges.
                
                And so, the saying "Half a loaf is better than none" became a timeless reminder that with determination, cooperation, and a positive mindset, even the smallest of provisions can lead to great achievements.

            <h1> SECTION B</h1>           
<p>6. 	Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it: </p><!--Questions appears here-->
       
    <p>  It was a cold windy Monday morning just before dawn. A frail old woman who could barely see beyond a few metres ahead of her - an early septuagenarian - braved all the odds and stepped out onto the dirt road in the village of Koomla. For her today's duty had be done even if it meant further risking her delicate health. "What would I not do for Koku to amount to something in this life that has given me noting but woes?” Mma Koku thought to herself.
        
        And so, despite the ominous signs from the sky and warning just a threadbare sweater over an equally aged wrapper, she forged ahead, daring the draught of air that was threatening to topple her. Luckily, the sand ground was still largely undisturbed owing to the dew, so she didn't have to contend with fending off particles from her often rheumy eyes.
        
        '‘Come what may.” Mma Koku assured herself as her left foot plonked into a muddy pothole she hadn’t seen in time, "today I shall see the Pathfinder, before he leaves for the city.” Her destination was still about nine kilometres away. At home. The Pathfinder, a respected middle-aged university teacher the very first person to earn the highest postgraduate degree from the village of Koomla - had just roused himself from dreamland. In the dream a figure in white had told him he owed an obligation to the woman. She was on her way to give him a parcel for her son studying at a university in the city, about a thousand miles away.
        
        The Pathfinder had come home for a two-day visit and the news had got to Mma Koku. who gladly took all of her savings for the last three months, put it in a small envelope and tied it up in the edge of her wrapper. The duo were to meet at the junction where the village road led off to the city'. “You know. Lord, that this is all I have. Please let my son turn out well,”' the old woman prayed ‘‘No sacrifice is too much for one's child,” she heaved, skipping over another muddy pothole, for it had rained the previous day.
        
        By the time Mma Koku got about a mile from the The Pathfinder’s home, the day was now bright enough for her to see with less strain. However, the sky suddenly became overcast and only seconds later there was a torrent from the heavens. There was very little that the suprised old woman could do to stave off the watery' onslaught, so she trudged on stoically. At the appointed place. The Pathfinder activated his wipers at top speed as he stayed on the look out for the person he was expecting.
        
        As drenched Mma Koku came into view. The Pathfinder switched off the ignition and rushed out to meet up with her, guiding her to a nearby shed. After a few minutes of pleasantries, she handed over her widow's mite. “Mma, please wait here till the sky stops weeping,” he begged her. “I must run along now.”
        
        “Ah, what can beat a mother’s love!” Dr. Felix Adoka soliloquised pensively, shaking his head as he winked a left turn to an oncoming driver, prepared to confront the elements. "I shall ensure her son gets a teaching job once he is done,” he promised himself.

      <h1> SECTION C
        SUMMARY
      </h1> 
      <p>7. Read the following passage carefully and answer the question on it. </p><!--Questions appears here-->
       
      <p> For all well meaning citizens, the moral decadence in our society nowadays is cause for concern. Some have argued that the root cause of this decadence is poor parenting. Indeed, poor parenting has given rise to most of the criminality' that we witness today. We all keep on complaining when, in fact, parents themselves are largely to blame for the unsavoury situation. In order to improve this situation, parents need to inculcate certain sterling qualities in their children.

        There is no doubt that temptations are bound to arise in everyday life. However, if lessons in self-control are instilled in children, they will be able to resist temptations. Children who have self-control are not likely to have problems with the law; moreover, they will be able to avoid health issues and financial stress, as well as other consequences of lack of self-restraint. For example, a child who has been taught to avoid eating junk food will not become obese. Such a child already knows that every action has a consequence.
        
        Today, many people consider themselves better than others and therefore look down on them. They are arrogant, impudent and intolerant; as such they are hardly ever willing to accommodate other people's ideas. A child who has imbibed the virtue of humility will be respectful, take interest in others and be willing to learn from them. Sometimes, humility is misconstrued as a weakness but in reality it is a strength which helps people to recognise their faults and acknowledge their limitations. Parents should ensure that their children take active part in chores and duties at home. They will therefore know that there is virtue in serving others.
        
        In life, we cannot avoid obstacles and disappointments. A child cannot learn how to walk without occasional falls. Similarly, in life we experience occasional setbacks. for example, a child may fail a test at school. In such a situation, what is needed is encouragement that will boost the child's confidence for future tests. Parents can help the child to work out a strategy for achieving resounding success. Children should be taught the truth in the axiom, “If you fail at first, try, try and try again.” This training in resilience helps children to face life’s challenges with confidence.
        
        Many adults lack integrity, so when they say “yes” they really mean “no”. They can therefore hardly be trusted or relied on and usually fail to take responsibility for their actions or failures. The actions of such adults have grave implications for society. If parents train their children on the need to have integrity, such children will not go about engaging in criminal activities.
        
        Cutting corners in order to get rich quick is the stock-in-trade of many adults, who now engage in all forms of illegal and unwholesome activities to acquire sudden wealth. Indeed, the culture of hard work is fast disappearing. If children are well trained in appreciating the value of hard work, they will grow up into adults who will shun all forms of shady activities aimed at making an overnight fortune.
        Obedience to laws is a key quality that will make any society stable and function smoothly. For example, if taxes are paid when due as stipulated by societal law s, money realised will be used to provide the badly needed social amenities and infrastructure. Parents have an important role to play by training their children to obey rules and regulations at home. This training will enable them to become law-abiding adults.
        
        In the light of the foregoing, parents should be good role models in terms of character, comportment, speech and dedication to duty among other things. Only under such circumstances can we build a stable society that benefits all.
