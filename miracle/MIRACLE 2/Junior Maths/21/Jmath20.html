            <div class="answer hidden">Let's break it down step by step:

The problem states that the sum of a certain number and 16 is 42. This can be written as an equation:
x + 16 = 42

Where x is the unknown number.

Our goal is to find the value of x. To do this, we can subtract 16 from both sides of the equation, which leaves us with:
x = 42 - 16

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
x = 26</div>

            <div class="answer hidden"> To find the product of (y-3) and (y+3), we can use the distributive property of multiplication over addition. This means that we can multiply each term in (y-3) by each term in (y+3).

Here's the step-by-step process:

Multiply the first term in (y-3) by the first term in (y+3):
(y-3) × (y+3) = y × y + y × 3 - 3 × y - 3 × 3

Expand the products:
y × y = y&#178;
y × 3 = 3y
-3 × y = -3y
-3 × 3 = -9

So, we get:

y&#178; + 3y - 3y - 9

Combine like terms:
y&#178; - 9</div>

            <div class="answer hidden">Let's break it down step by step:

Let the son's age be x. Then, the man's age is x + 26 (since the man is 26 years older than his son).
The problem states that the man is also 8 years older than three times his son's age. We can write this as an equation:
x + 26 = 3x + 8

Subtract x from both sides to get:
26 = 2x + 8

Subtract 8 from both sides to get:
18 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2 to get:
x = 9</div>

Let's start by finding two numbers whose product is -12 and whose sum is 1. These numbers are -3 and 4, since (-3) × (4) = -12 and (-3) + 4 = 1.

So, we can write the expression as:

            <div class="answer hidden">To simplify \(\frac{2x+1}{2} - \frac{3x+7}{3}\), you need to find a common denominator for the fractions and then combine them. 

The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. 

So, let's rewrite the fractions with the common denominator of 6:

\[\frac{3(2x+1)}{6} - \frac{2(3x+7)}{6}\]

This simplifies to:

\[\frac{6x+3}{6} - \frac{6x+14}{6}\]

Now, you can combine the fractions:

\[\frac{(6x+3) - (6x+14)}{6}\]

Expanding the parentheses:

\[\frac{6x+3 - 6x - 14}{6}\]

Now, simplify the numerator:

I completely agree with your steps:

1. You grouped the terms correctly: \((4x^2 - 6x) + (-3y + 2xy)\)
2. You factored out the common terms from each group: \(2x(2x - 3) + y(2x - 3)\)
3. You noticed that both terms have a common factor of \((2x - 3)\) and factored it out: \((2x - 3)(2x + y)\)

And indeed, the factored form of the expression is:

4x² - 3y - 6x + 2xy = (2x - 3)(2x + y)</div>

 Multiply both sides of the equation by the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, which is (x+2)(3x-1). This eliminates the fractions:

2(3x-1) = 5(x+2)

Step 2: Expand and simplify

Expand both sides of the equation:

6x - 2 = 5x + 10

Subtract 5x from both sides:

x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

**Step 1: Simplify the left side**

Combine like terms on the left side:

4x = 8x²

**Step 2: Move all terms to one side**

Subtract 4x from both sides:

0 = 8x² - 4x

**Step 3: Factor the quadratic expression**

Factor the right side:

0 = (4x)(2x - 1)

**Step 4: Set each factor equal to 0 and solve for x**

Set each factor equal to 0 and solve for x:

4x = 0 => x = 0

2x - 1 = 0 => x = 1/2

So, the solutions to the equation are x = 0 and x = 1/2.</div>

                <div class="answer hidden">Let's solve the simultaneous equations step by step:

**Step 1: Write the equations in standard form**

We're given the equations:

x - 2y + 3 = 0 ... (Equation 1)
3x + 2y = 7 ... (Equation 2)

**Step 2: Rearrange one of the equations to isolate a variable**

Rearrange Equation 1 to isolate x:

x = 2y - 3

**Step 3: Substitute the expression for x into the other equation**

Substitute x = 2y - 3 into Equation 2:

3(2y - 3) + 2y = 7

**Step 4: Simplify and solve for y**

Expand and simplify:

6y - 9 + 2y = 7
8y - 9 = 7
8y = 16
y = 2

**Step 5: Substitute the value of y back into one of the original equations to find x**

Substitute y = 2 into the equation x = 2y - 3:

x = 2(2) - 3
= 4 - 3

So, the solution to the simultaneous equations is x = 1 and y = 2.</div>

                <div class="answer hidden">Let's solve the system of equations!

We have two equations:

1. y - 2x = 3
2. x + y = 3

Our goal is to find the values of x and y.

**Step 1: Solve the first equation for y**

Add 2x to both sides of the first equation:

y - 2x + 2x = 3 + 2x

This simplifies to:

y = 3 + 2x

**Step 2: Substitute the expression for y into the second equation**

Substitute the expression for y (from step 1) into the second equation:

(x) + (3 + 2x) = 3

Expand and simplify:

x + 3 + 2x = 3

Combine like terms:

3x + 3 = 3

Subtract 3 from both sides:

3x = 0

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 0

**Step 3: Find the value of y using the expression from step 1**

Now that we know x, we can substitute it into the expression for y from step 1:

y = 3 + 2x
= 3 + 2(0)
= 3

So, the values of x and y are:

x = 0
y = 3

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is x = 0 and y = 3.</div>

                <div class="answer hidden">We have two equations:

1. 4x + 2y = 0
2. 3x - y = 5

Our goal is to find the value of x + y.

**Step 1: Solve the first equation for y**

Divide both sides of the first equation by 2:

2y = -4x

Subtract -4x from both sides:

y = -2x

**Step 2: Substitute the expression for y into the second equation**

Substitute the expression for y (from step 1) into the second equation:

3x - (-2x) = 5

Simplify:

3x + 2x = 5

Combine like terms:

5x = 5

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 1

**Step 3: Find the value of y using the expression from step 1**

Now that we know x, we can substitute it into the expression for y from step 1:

y = -2x
= -2(1)
= -2

So, the values of x and y are:

x = 1
y = -2

Now, we can find the value of x + y:

x + y = 1 + (-2)
= 1 - 2
= -1

Therefore, the value of x + y is -1.</div>

                <div class="answer hidden">To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that:

a² + b² = c²

where a and b are the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse (the diagonal).

In this case, we have a rectangle with length (a) = 4m and breadth (b) = 3m. We can draw a diagonal from one corner of the rectangle to the opposite corner, which forms a right-angled triangle.

Let's label the length of the diagonal as c. We can plug in the values into the Pythagorean theorem:

4² + 3² = c²
16 + 9 = c²
25 = c²

Now, take the square root of both sides:

c = √25
c = 5m</div>

Number of applicants with master's degree = 50 × 0.2 = 10

2. Since there are 50 applicants in total, and we've found that 10 have a master's degree, we can subtract 10 from 50 to find the number of applicants with a first degree certificate:

I can help with that!

Let's break it down step by step:

**Step 1: Simplify the numbers**

We can divide the numerator (18) by the denominator (9) to get:

18 ÷ 9 = 2

So, the simplified fraction of the numbers is:

2

**Step 2: Simplify the variables**

Now, let's look at the variables (x, y, and z). To simplify them, we need to subtract the exponents of the variables in the numerator and denominator.

For x:
Numerator: x^3
Denominator: x^2
Subtract exponents: x^3 - x^2 = x^1
So, the simplified expression for x is: x

For y:
Numerator: y^1
Denominator: y^2
Subtract exponents: y^1 - y^2 = y^-1
So, the simplified expression for y is: 1/y

For z:
Numerator: z^3
Denominator: z^1
Subtract exponents: z^3 - z^1 = z^2
So, the simplified expression for z is: z^2

**Step 3: Combine the simplified numbers and variables**

Now that we have simplified the numbers and variables, we can combine them to get the final simplified expression:

2 × x × (1/y) × z^2

We can simplify this expression further by combining the factors:

2 × x × z^2 × 1/y

This becomes:

2xz^2 / y

Wait, what's this? It looks like we still have a fraction! But we can simplify it further by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by y to get:

2xz^2

And that's our final simplified expression!

So, the simplified expression is 2xz&#178;. </div>

Our goal is to simplify this expression by combining like terms and eliminating any fractions.

First, let's focus on the fractions. We can combine the two fractions by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and b, which is b. So, we can rewrite the expression as:

(1/2b) × 1 + (2/b) × 1 - 5

Now, we can simplify the fractions by multiplying both numerator and denominator by b:

(1/2) × 1 × b + (2/1) × 1 × b - 5

This simplifies to:

(1/2b) × b + (2/1) × b - 5

Now, we can combine like terms:

(b/2) + 2b - 5

Finally, we can combine the two terms with a variable (b):

                <div class="answer hidden">Let's solve the equation step by step.

Given equation: y - 3/3 - y/2 = 0

First, we can combine the fractions on the left side of the equation:

y - (1/1) - (3/2) = 0

Now, we can simplify the fractions by multiplying both numerator and denominator by 2:

y - 1 - (3/2) × 1 = 0

This simplifies to:

y - 1 - 3/2 = 0

Next, we can combine the constant terms on the left side of the equation:

y - (1 + 3/2) = 0

Now, we can simplify the fraction by multiplying both numerator and denominator by 2:

y - (2 + 3) = 0

This simplifies to:

y - 5 = 0

Finally, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation to solve for y:

y = 5

                <div class="answer hidden">To find the value of p, we need to substitute x = -2 and the equation 2x + 5y = 25 into the table.

From the table, we know that:

x = -2, y = p

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

2(-2) + 5p = 25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

-4 + 5p = 25

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:

5p = 29

Dividing both sides of the equation by 5, we get:

p = 29/5

p = 5.8

So, the value of p is 5.8.</div>

0 + 5q = 25

Subtracting 0 from both sides of the equation, we get:

5q = 25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Combining like terms, we get:

25 = 25

This equation is true, so we can conclude that r = 4.6.

Now, we can calculate the value of 2q - r:

2q - r = 2(5) - 4.6

We are also told that the total cost of the trousers and shoes together is N2,800.00. This means that we can set up an equation:

1,600 + q = 2,800

To solve for q, we can subtract 1,600 from both sides of the equation:

q = 2,800 - 1,600

So, the cost of the pair of shoes is N1,200.</div>

To find the mode, median, and sum of the mode and median, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the mode:
The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the set. In this case, the value 3 appears three times, which is more than any other value. Therefore, the mode is 3.

2. Find the median:
To find the median, we need to arrange the numbers in order from smallest to largest: 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3.

Since there are an even number of values (6), the median is the average of the two middle values. The two middle values are 2 and 2. So, the median is:

Median = (2 + 2) / 2 = 2

3. Find the sum of the mode and median:
Now that we have found the mode (3) and median (2), we can add them together:

Sum = Mode + Median = 3 + 2 = 5

So, the sum of the mode and median is 5.</div>

                <div class="answer hidden">Since we don't have the exact value of JSS 1, we can't determine the exact fraction of the whole school it represents. However, we can make an educated guess if we assume that the diagram is a representation of the total number of students in the school.

If we let JSS 1 = x, then we can express the total number of students in the school as:

x + 110 + 100

To find the fraction of the whole school that JSS 1 represents, we can divide the value of JSS 1 (x) by the total number of students and simplify:

Fraction of JSS 1 = x / (x + 110 + 100)

Since we don't know the value of x, we can't simplify this fraction further. If you could provide the actual value of JSS 1, we could calculate the exact fraction.

However, if you're looking for a rough estimate, you could assume that JSS 1 represents a small percentage of the whole school. For example, if JSS 1 had a value of 20, then the fraction would be:

Fraction of JSS 1 = 20 / (20 + 110 + 100) = 20 / 230 ≈ 0.087 or about 8.7%

Keep in mind that this is just a rough estimate, and the actual value of JSS 1 could be significantly different.</div>

We know that JSS 2 has a value of 110 degrees, but we're not sure what that represents. However, we can assume that it's a numerical value, not an angle or measurement. Let's use the value as a numerical value.

The total number of students in the school is 180, and we're looking for the number of students in JSS 2. We can set up an equation using the information provided:

JSS 2 + JSS 3 = 180 - JSS 1

We're not given the value of JSS 1, but we can substitute the values given for JSS 2 and JSS 3:

JSS 2 + 100 = 180 - ?

Since JSS 2 has a value of 110, we can substitute that value into the equation:

110 + 100 = 180 - ?

Combine like terms:

210 = 180 - ?

Subtract 180 from both sides:

30 = ?

So, JSS 1 has a value of 30. However, since we're not looking for the value of JSS 1, we can ignore this result.

To find the number of students in JSS 2, we can subtract the value of JSS 3 from the total number of students:

Number of students in JSS 2 = Total number of students - Number of students in JSS 3
= 180 - 100
= 80

Therefore, there are 80 students in JSS 2.</div>

                <div class="answer hidden">A nice problem! Let's break it down step by step.

Given:

* The mean age of 5 pupils is 8 years.
* The ages of the pupils are: 6, 9, x, 7, 8.

We need to find the median age.

Step 1: Find the mean age

To find the mean age, we add up all the ages and divide by 5:

(6 + 9 + x + 7 + 8) / 5 = 8

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

6 + 9 + x + 7 + 8 = 40

Combine like terms:

30 + x = 40

Subtract 30 from both sides:

x = 10

So, the unknown age x is 10.

Step 2: Find the median age

To find the median age, we need to arrange the ages in order from smallest to largest:

6, 7, 8, 9, 10

Since there are an odd number of pupils (5), the middle value is the median. In this case, the median age is:

8 years

Therefore, the median age of the five pupils is 8 years.</div>

                <div class="answer hidden">Another great problem! Let's solve it step by step.

Given:

* The mean weight of 4 students is 26 kg.
* The mean weight of 5 students is 24 kg.
* We need to find the weight of the 5th student.

Step 1: Find the total weight of the 4 students

Since the mean weight of the 4 students is 26 kg, we can multiply the number of students by the mean weight to find the total weight:

4 students × 26 kg = 104 kg

Step 2: Find the total weight of all 5 students

When the 5th student joins, the mean weight decreases to 24 kg. We can multiply the number of students (5) by the mean weight (24) to find the total weight:

5 students × 24 kg = 120 kg

Step 3: Find the difference in total weight

The total weight of the 4 students is 104 kg, and the total weight of all 5 students is 120 kg. To find the difference, subtract the smaller value from the larger value:

120 kg - 104 kg = 16 kg

This means that the weight of the additional student (the 5th student) is equal to the difference in total weight:

Weight of the 5th student = 16 kg

Therefore, the weight of the fifth student is 16 kg.</div>

The pie chart shows the distribution of Mr. Tanko's income in a month, and the given values are:

* Shelter: 56
* Transportation: 54
* Education: 108
* Music: 52

Since the total monthly salary is N100,000.00, we can set up an equation to represent the total amount:

Shelter + Transportation + Education + Music = N100,000.00

We can add up the values given:

56 + 54 + 108 + 52 = ?

Let's calculate the sum:

Now, we know that the total amount is N100,000.00. To find the amount spent on education, we need to subtract the sum of the other categories from the total amount:

Education = Total Amount - (Shelter + Transportation + Music)
= N100,000.00 - (56 + 54 + 52)
= N100,000.00 - 162
= N100,000.00 - N162.00
= N98,838.00

So, Mr. Tanko spends N98,838.00 on education.</div>

**Finding the Median**

To find the median of a set of numbers, we need to first arrange the numbers in order from smallest to largest. Here are the numbers you provided:

4, 6, 8, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 16, 16

Now, let's find the median. Since there are 11 numbers (an odd number), the middle value is the median.

To find the median, we can count the numbers:

1. 4
2. 6
3. 8
4. 8
5. 10
6. 12
7. **13** (middle value)
8. 14
9. 16
10. 16
11. 16

The median is the middle value, which is **13**.

**Finding the Mean**

If you're interested in finding the mean (also known as the average) of the rainfall data, we can do that too!

The formula for finding the mean is:

Mean = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)

Let's calculate the mean for the rainfall data:

month = jan, feb, mar, apr, may
amount of rainfall = 35, 42, 50, 65,78

First, let's add up all the values:

35 + 42 + 50 + 65 + 78 = 270

Now, we divide the sum by the number of values:

270 ÷ 5 = **54**

So, the mean rainfall for January to May is **54** mm³.

To find the percentage of the rainfall in February, we need to know the total rainfall in February and the total rainfall for the entire period (January to May).

According to the data, the rainfall in February is **42** mm³.

The total rainfall for January to May is **270** mm³, which we calculated earlier.

To find the percentage of the rainfall in February, we can use the following formula:

Percentage = (Value of February rainfall / Total rainfall) × 100

Plugging in the values, we get:

Percentage = (42 / 270) × 100
= 0.155555556 (approximately)
= **15.56%**

So, the percentage of the rainfall in February is approximately **15.56%** of the total rainfall from January to May.

                <div class="answer hidden"> A classic probability problem!

When a fair die is thrown, there are 6 possible outcomes:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6

To find the probability of obtaining an even number, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes (even numbers) and divide it by the total number of outcomes.

The favorable outcomes are:

2, 4, and 6

There are 3 even numbers out of the 6 possible outcomes.

So, the probability of obtaining an even number when a fair die is thrown once is:

Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)
= 3/6
= **1/2**

Alternatively, you can write the probability as a decimal or a percentage:

Probability = 0.5 (or) 50%

Therefore, the probability of obtaining an even number when a fair die is thrown once is **1/2** or **50%**.</div>
